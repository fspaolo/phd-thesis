%% DEDICATION
%
%  You have three choices here:
%    1. Use the ``dedication'' environment. 
%       Put in the text you want, and everything will be formated for 
%       you. You'll get a perfectly respectable dedication page.
%   
%    2. Use the ``mydedication'' environment.  If you don't like the
%       formatting of option 1, use this environment and format things
%       however you wish.
%
%    3. If you don't want a dedication, it's not required.
%
%
\begin{dedication} 
  To two, the loneliest number since the number one.
\end{dedication}


% \begin{mydedication} % You are responsible for formatting here.
%   \vspace{1in}
%   \begin{flushleft}
% 	To me.
%   \end{flushleft}
%   
%   \vspace{2in}
%   \begin{center}
% 	And you.
%   \end{center}
% 
%   \vspace{2in}
%   \begin{flushright}
% 	Which equals us.
%   \end{flushright}
% \end{mydedication}



%% EPIGRAPH
%
%  The same choices that applied to the dedication apply here.
%
\begin{epigraph} % The style file will position the text for you.
\emph{
It should never assert as argument the authority of any man, by excellent and illustrious that is... It is extremely unfair to fold one's own feeling to a slavish reverence towards others; being submissive is worthy of mercenaries or slaves and contrary to the dignity of human freedom; it is utmost stupidity to believe by inveterate custom; it is irrational thing to conform with an opinion because of the number of those who have it. We must instead always seek a real and necessary reason... \\
and listen to the voice of nature.
} \\
---Giordano Bruno \\
(burned at the stake, 1548--1600)

% \begin{myepigraph} % You position the text yourself.
