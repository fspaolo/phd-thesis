  abstract = {Over the past 40 years Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica has thinned at an accelerating rate, so that at present it is the largest single contributor to sea-level rise in Antarctica. In recent years, the grounding line, which separates the grounded ice sheet from the floating ice shelf, has retreated by tens of kilometres. At present, the grounding line is crossing a retrograde bedrock slope that lies well below sea level, raising the possibility that the glacier is susceptible to the marine ice-sheet instability mechanism. Here, using three state-of-the-art ice-flow models, we show that Pine Island Glacier's grounding line is probably engaged in an unstable 40 km retreat. The associated mass loss increases substantially over the course of our simulations from the average value of 20 Gt yr-1 observed for the 1992{\textendash}2011 period, up to and above 100 Gt yr-1, equivalent to 3.5{\textendash}10 mm eustatic sea-level rise over the following 20 years. Mass loss remains elevated from then on, ranging from 60 to 120 Gt yr-1.},

The break-in-slope, as an indirect estimate of grounding line location, was mapped for the entire AIS. We have also mapped 55\% of the landward edge and 30\% of the seaward edge of the ice shelf flexure boundary for the AIS perimeter. Vertical ice motion from Global Positioning System receivers confirms the location of the satellite-derived GZ in two regions. Our map redefines the extent of floating ice in the south-western AIS and identifies several previously unmapped grounded regions, improving our understanding of the stresses supporting the current dynamical state of the ice shelf. Finally, we identify three along-flow channels in the ice shelf basal topography, approximately 10 km apart, 1.5 km wide and 300{\textendash}500 m deep, near the southern GZ. These channels, which form at the suture zones between ice streams, may represent zones of potential weakness in the ice shelf and may influence sub-ice-shelf ocean circulation.},

The pattern of thinning extends to distances greater than 150 km inland. Between 1991 and 2001, the TG and SG thinned by more than 25 and 45 m at their grounding lines, and a total of 154 +/- 16 km(3) of ice (or 0.43 mm of eustatic sea level rise) was lost from the AS sector glaciers to the ocean.

The warmest waters to reach this region are channeled through a submarine trough, accessed via bathymetric irregularities along the shelf break. Temporal variability in the influx of CDW is related to regional wind forcing. Easterly winds over the shelf edge change to westerlies when the Amundsen Sea Low migrates west and south in winter/spring. This drives seasonal on-shelf flow, while inter-annual changes in the wind forcing lead to inflow variability on a decadal timescale. A modelled period of warming following low CDW influx in the late 1980's and early 1990's coincides with a period of observed thinning and acceleration of Pine Island Glacier.},

The total balance includes both the surface mass balance processes and the ice-flow components. Mass is added to the surface from snowfall, condensation, and occasional rainfall. Mass is removed by evaporation, surface and bottom melting, water runoff, and iceberg discharge. The chapter discusses the radar altimeter measurement of ice-sheet surface elevations. Several methods have been used to create the digital elevation models (DEMs) of ice sheet topography from satellite altimetry. All methods involve mapping the data onto evenly spaced grids and correcting for the slope error, either before or after the mapping. Full DEMs of Greenland and Antarctica have been produced using triangularization or gridding procedures. A three-step inversion technique has also been demonstrated in small regions by Remy et al: first a large-scale reference surface is estimated, the residuals are mapped related to the undulations, and finally iteratively corrected for the slope error.},

Pine Island Glacier in Antarctica has thinned significantly during the last two decades and has provided a measurable contribution to sea-level rise as a result. Both glacier dynamics and climate are thought to be responsible for thinning, but exactly how they influence the glacier are incompletely known. Dutrieux et al. (p. 174, published online 2 January) provide another layer of detail to our understanding of the process through observations of ocean temperatures in the surrounding waters. The thermocline adjacent in the sea adjacent to the glacier calving front (where ice is discharged) lowered by 250 meters in the austral summer of 2012. This change exposed the bottom of the ice shelf to colder surface waters rather than to the warmer, deeper layer, thereby reducing heat transfer from the ocean to the overlying ice and decreasing basal melting of the ice by more than 50\% compared to 2010. Those 2012 ocean conditions were partly caused by a strong La Ni{\~n}a event, thus illustrating how important atmospheric variability is for regulating how the Antarctic Ice Sheet responds to climate change.
Pine Island Glacier has thinned and accelerated over recent decades, significantly contributing to global sea-level rise. Increased oceanic melting of its ice shelf is thought to have triggered those changes. Observations and numerical modeling reveal large fluctuations in the ocean heat available in the adjacent bay and enhanced sensitivity of ice-shelf melting to water temperatures at intermediate depth, as a seabed ridge blocks the deepest and warmest waters from reaching the thickest ice. Oceanic melting decreased by 50\% between January 2010 and 2012, with ocean conditions in 2012 partly attributable to atmospheric forcing associated with a strong La Ni{\~n}a event. Both atmospheric variability and local ice shelf and seabed geometry play fundamental roles in determining the response of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to climate.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the impact of the error due to the penetration of the altimetric wave within the snowpack. The phenomenon has two different impacts. The first one, due to temporal change in snow characteristics, affects the ice sheet volume trend as derived from altimetric series. The second one, because of both the anisotropy of the ice sheet surface properties and of the linear antenna polarization, introduces a difference in measurements at crossover points. These two phenomena are the cause of what are probably the most critical limitations to the interpretation of long-term altimetric series in term of mass balance and to the comparison between or data fusion of different missions. Moreover, they will lead to the largest error when comparing data from EnviSat with data from CryoSat, because of the different orbits, or with data from AltiKa, because of the different radar frequencies. We show that waveform distortions due to snow characteristics fluctuation are complex. In the central part of the East Antarctica, the height and the leading edge width fluctuations vary together while elsewhere, height fluctuations may occur with no variations in the waveform shape, mostly during winter. As a consequence, these induced errors cannot be corrected with solely the help of the backscatter: waveform shape parameters are also needed. They are however not enough to fully correct these two errors. We propose an empirical correction for these effects. We show that crossover differences may be significantly reduced to up 22 cm. In terms of volume change, the estimation may vary up to 4 cm/yr at cross-overs depending on the correction used and is reduced in average to 2.3 cm/yr with our correction. The difference between the height trends estimated with both corrections is weak in average but may locally reach 5 cm/yr with a clear geographical pattern. ?? 2011 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

steady-state model version is used to simulate the strong spatial variability in firn layer thickness across the Antarctic ice
sheet. Second, the time-dependent model is run for 3 Antarctic locations with different climate conditions. Surface height changes are caused by a combination of accumulation, melting
and firn densification processes. On all 3 locations, an upward trend of the surface during autumn, winter and spring is present, while during summer there is a more rapid lowering of the surface. Accumulation and (if present) melt introduce large inter-annual variability in surface height trends, possibly
hiding ice dynamical thickening and thinning.},

Using a numerical model, we investigated the sensitivity of Thwaites Glacier to ocean melt and whether its unstable retreat is already under way. Our model reproduces observed losses when forced with ocean melt comparable to estimates. Simulated losses are moderate (\ensuremath{<}0.25 mm per year at sea level) over the 21st century but generally increase thereafter. Except possibly for the lowest-melt scenario, the simulations indicate that early-stage collapse has begun. Less certain is the time scale, with the onset of rapid (\ensuremath{>}1 mm per year of sea-level rise) collapse in the different simulations within the range of 200 to 900 years.
Antarctic Collapse
The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is particularly vulnerable to ocean warming-induced collapse. The Thwaites Glacier of West Antarctica is one of the largest WAIS regional contributors to sea level rise, and has been considered to be potentially unstable for many years. Joughin et al. (p. 735) used a combination of a numerical model and observations of its recent geometry and movement to investigate the stability of the Thwaites Glacier. The glacier has already entered the early stages of collapse, and rapid and irreversible collapse is likely in the next 200 to 1000 years.},

This pattern of temperature change has been attributed to the increased strength of the circumpolar westerlies, largely in response to changes in stratospheric ozone. This picture, however, is substantially incomplete owing to the sparseness and short duration of the observations. Here we show that significant warming extends well beyond the Antarctic Peninsula to cover most of West Antarctica, an area of warming much larger than previously reported. West Antarctic warming exceeds 0.1 degrees C per decade over the past 50 years, and is strongest in winter and spring. Although this is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica, the continent-wide average near-surface temperature trend is positive. Simulations using a general circulation model reproduce the essential features of the spatial pattern and the long-term trend, and we suggest that neither can be attributed directly to increases in the strength of the westerlies. Instead, regional changes in atmospheric circulation and associated changes in sea surface temperature and sea ice are required to explain the enhanced warming in West Antarctica.},

Depending on the density of the snow giving rise to the observed elevation fluctuations, the ice sheet mass trend falls in the range -5-+85Gtyr-1. We find that data from climate model reanalyses are not able to characterise the contemporary snowfall fluctuation with useful accuracy and our best estimate of the overall mass trend-growth of 27+/-29Gtyr-1-is based on an assessment of the expected snowfall variability. Mass gains from accumulating snow, particularly on the Antarctic Peninsula and within East Antarctica, exceed the ice dynamic mass loss from West Antarctica.

Some scope remains for methodological improvements using a single data type. In this study we report our progress in increasing the accuracy and spatial resolution of time-variable gravimetry from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). We determine the geographic pattern of ice mass change in Antarctica between January\hspace{0.25em}2003 and June\hspace{0.25em}2014, accounting for glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA) using the IJ05\_R2 model. Expressing the unknown signal in a sparse Slepian basis constructed by optimization to prevent leakage out of the regions of interest, we use robust signal processing and statistical estimation methods. Applying those to the latest time series of monthly GRACE solutions we map Antarctica's mass loss in space and time as well as can be recovered from satellite gravity alone. Ignoring GIA model uncertainty, over the period 2003{\textendash}2014, West Antarctica has been losing ice mass at a rate of - 121 \ensuremath{\pm} 8   Gt / yr and has experienced large acceleration of ice mass losses along the Amundsen Sea coast of - 18 \ensuremath{\pm} 5   Gt / yr 2 , doubling the mass loss rate in the past six years. The Antarctic Peninsula shows slightly accelerating ice mass loss, with larger accelerated losses in the southern half of the Peninsula. Ice mass gains due to snowfall in Dronning Maud Land have continued to add about half the amount of West Antarctica's loss back onto the continent over the last decade. We estimate the overall mass losses from Antarctica since January 2003 at - 92 \ensuremath{\pm} 10   Gt / yr .},

ICESat has provided surface elevation measurements of the ice sheets since the launch in January 2003, resulting in a unique dataset for monitoring the changes of the cryosphere. Here, we present a novel method for determining the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet, derived from ICESat altimetry data. Three different methods for deriving elevation changes from the ICESat altimetry dataset are used. This multimethod approach provides a method to assess the complexity of deriving elevation changes from this dataset. The altimetry alone can not provide an estimate of the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet. Firn dynamics and surface densities are important factors that contribute
to the mass change derived from remote-sensing altimetry. The volume change derived from ICESat data is corrected for changes in firn compaction over the observation period, vertical bedrock movement and an intercampaign elevation bias in the ICESat data. Subsequently, the corrected volume change is converted into mass change by the application of a simple surface density model, in which some of the ice dynamics are accounted for. The firn compaction and density models are driven by the HIRHAM5 regional climate model, forced by the ERA-Interim re-analysis product, at the lateral boundaries. We find annual mass loss estimates of the Greenland ice sheet in the range of 191\ensuremath{\pm}23 Gt yr-1 to 240\ensuremath{\pm}28 Gt yr-1 for the period October 2003 to March 2008. These results are in good agreement with several other studies of the Greenland ice sheet mass balance, based on different remote-sensing techniques.},

In this paper, we perform an analysis of the ERS1 altimeter dataset acquired during a 3 day repeat orbit. The analysis reveals that there are temporal variations in shapes of the radar altimeter echo and that these variations are linked to meteorological phenomena. The time- and space-scales over which these variations apply are a few to tens of days and a few hundred kilometres, respectively. This phenomenon, if not accounted for, can create error in the height measurement. A numerical echo model is used to recover snowpack characteristics by taking advantage of the temporal variations of the radar echoes, A map of penetration depth of the radar waves in the Ku band over the;Antarctic continent is obtained and suggests that grain-size produces the dominant effect on radar extinction in the snowpack at this frequency. Finally, a procedure is proposed to correct the height measurement within the contest of ice-sheet mass-balance survey.},

Climate warming may increase snowfall in the continent's interior1, 2, 3, but enhance glacier discharge at the coast where warmer air and ocean temperatures erode the buttressing ice shelves4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Here, we use satellite interferometric synthetic-aperture radar observations from 1992 to 2006 covering 85\% of Antarctica's coastline to estimate the total mass flux into the ocean. We compare the mass fluxes from large drainage basin units with interior snow accumulation calculated from a regional atmospheric climate model for 1980 to 2004. In East Antarctica, small glacier losses in Wilkes Land and glacier gains at the mouths of the Filchner and Ross ice shelves combine to a near-zero loss of 4\ensuremath{\pm}61\hspace{0.167em}Gt\hspace{0.167em}yr-1. In West Antarctica, widespread losses along the Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas increased the ice sheet loss by 59\% in 10 years to reach 132\ensuremath{\pm}60\hspace{0.167em}Gt\hspace{0.167em}yr-1 in 2006. In the Peninsula, losses increased by 140\% to reach 60\ensuremath{\pm}46\hspace{0.167em}Gt\hspace{0.167em}yr-1 in 2006. Losses are concentrated along narrow channels occupied by outlet glaciers and are caused by ongoing and past glacier acceleration. Changes in glacier flow therefore have a significant, if not dominant impact on ice sheet mass balance.},

Time-varying rates of mass loss contribute to this, but substantial technique-specific systematic errors also exist. In particular, estimates of secular ice-mass change derived from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data are dominated by significant uncertainty in the accuracy of models of mass change due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). Here we adopt a new model of GIA, developed from geological constraints, which produces GIA rates systematically lower than those of previous models, and an improved fit to independent uplift data. After applying the model to 99 months (from August 2002 to December 2010) of GRACE data, we estimate a continent-wide ice-mass change of -69 \ensuremath{\pm} 18 Gt yr(-1) (+0.19 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.05 mm yr(-1) sea-level equivalent). This is about a third to a half of the most recently published GRACE estimates, which cover a similar time period but are based on older GIA models. Plausible GIA model uncertainties, and errors relating to removing longitudinal GRACE artefacts ('destriping'), confine our estimate to the range -126 Gt yr(-1) to -29 Gt yr(-1) (0.08-0.35 mm yr(-1) sea-level equivalent). We resolve 26 independent drainage basins and find that Antarctic mass loss, and its acceleration, is concentrated in basins along the Amundsen Sea coast. Outside this region, we find that West Antarctica is nearly in balance and that East Antarctica is gaining substantial mass.},

  abstract = {We describe a new tide model for the seas surrounding Antarctica, including the ocean cavities under the floating ice shelves. The model uses data assimilation to improve its fit to available data. Typical peak-to-peak tide ranges on ice shelves are 1-2 m but can exceed 3 m for the Filchner-Ronne and Larsen Ice Shelves in the Weddell Sea. Spring tidal ranges are about twice these values. Model performance is judged relative to the {\textasciitilde}5-10 cm accuracy that is needed to fully utilize ice-shelf height data that will be collected with the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System, scheduled to be launched on the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite in late 2002. The model does not yet achieve this level of accuracy except very near the few high-quality tidal records that have been assimilated into the model. Some improvement in predictive skill is expected from increased sophistication of model physics, but we also require better definition of ice-shelf grounding lines and more accurate water-column thickness data in shelf seas and under the ice shelves. Long-duration tide measurements (bottom pressure gauge or global positioning system) in critical datasparse areas, particularly near and on the Filchner-Ronne and Ross Ice Shelves and Pine Island Bay, are required to improve the performance of the data-assimilation model.},

  doi = {10.1029/2011JC007301},
  abstract = {Several Antarctic Peninsula (AP) ice shelves have lost significant fractions of their volume over the past decades, coincident with rapid regional climate change. Wilkins Ice Shelf (WIS), on the western side of the AP, is the most recent, experiencing a sequence of large calving events in 2008 and 2009. We analyze the mass balance for WIS for the period 1992-2008 and find that the averaged rate of ice-shelf thinning was \ensuremath{\sim}0.8 m a-1, driven by a mean basal melt rate of 〈wb〉 = 1.3 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.4 m a-1. Interannual variability was large, associated with changes in both surface mass accumulation and 〈wb〉. Basal melt rate declined significantly around 2000 from 1.8 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.4 m a-1 for 1992{\textendash}2000 to \ensuremath{\sim}0.75 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.55 m a-1 for 2001{\textendash}2008; the latter value corresponding to approximately steady-state ice-shelf mass. Observations of ocean temperature T obtained during 2007{\textendash}2009 by instrumented seals reveal a cold, deep halo of Winter Water (WW; T \ensuremath{\approx} -1.6{\textdegree}C) surrounding WIS. The base of the WW in the halo is \ensuremath{\sim}170 m, approximately the mean ice draft for WIS. We hypothesize that the transition in 〈wb〉 in 2000 was caused by a small perturbation (\ensuremath{\sim}10{\textendash}20 m) in the relative depths of the ice base and the bottom of the WW layer in the halo. We conclude that basal melting of thin ice shelves like WIS is very sensitive to upper-ocean and coastal processes that act on shorter time and space scales than those affecting basal melting of thicker West Antarctic ice shelves such as George VI and Pine Island Glacier.},

Three independent methods now exist for assessing ice-sheet mass balance and we focus on progress in two: satellite altimetry (ICESat) and gravimetry (GRACE). With improved spatial and temporal sampling, and synergy with ice flow measurements, both the mechanisms and causes changing
mass balance can be investigated. We present examples of mass losses due to widespread, intensifying glacier dynamic thinning in northwest Greenland, but local ablation rates in the northeast that are unchanged for decades. Advances in GRACE processing reveal Greenland net ice-sheet mass loss
continuing into 2010, at 19530 Gt a{\textendash}1. A similarly negative trend in the Gulf of Alaska has significant spatial and temporal variation, that highlights the importance of intense summer melting here. Strong
summer melt on the Antarctic Peninsula also precipitated recent ice-shelf collapse and prompted rapid dynamic thinning of tributary glaciers at up to 70ma{\textendash}1. Thinning continued for years to decades after collapse and propagated far inland. While understanding of the physical mechanisms of change continues to improve, estimates of future behaviour, and in particular the near-future glacial sea-level contribution, still rely on projections from such observations.We introduce the suite of new sensors that
will monitor the ice sheets into the future.},

  abstract = {In Antarctica, radar altimeter measurements are sensitive to dielectric and penetration properties of the sensed medium (snow) such that the spacecraft's altitude can be biased. Since 2002, relatively low frequency radar measurements over the Amery Ice Shelf, east Antarctica, have been acquired using the Envisat dual frequency altimeter at S (3.2 GHz) and Ku (13.6 GHz) bands, which penetrate a few meters into the firn. The altimeter signal is however modified in summer by the presence of snowfilled crevasses. Indeed, the specularity of the snow surfaces in summer makes the altimetric signal sensitive mostly to nadir echoes, that increases the ratio between the crevasse signal and the surrounding ice-shelf signal at nadir. Crevasses are distinguished by differences in backscattering behavior compared with the surrounding ice-shelf signal. Crevasses are characterized by a strong backscatter coefficient at Ku band and anomalies in the S band altitude estimation. These two characteristics make snowfilled crevasses detectable by the dual frequency altimeter of Envisat. We first retrieve the geometric properties of the crevasses using a hyperbolic shape function, created by strong crevasse backscatter in the Ku waveform measurements. From this retrieved crevasse signal and further waveform analysis, we assess the properties of the snow surface and its sub-surface. The crevasse, due to its small size compared to the altimeter footprint, is found to be an excellent target to study snow properties of the ice-shelf. The anomalies in the S band altitude measurements over crevasses can then be explained by the presence of a double echo in the S band waveforms. This echo is attributed to a reflection at the base of the snowbridge, where we see evidence of sub-surface echos in the individual altimeter waveforms. Based on this observation, a methodology is developed to estimate the thickness of the snowbridge. We calculate the penetration depths in the summer snow surface of the Amery at Ku band, that is found to be around 6 m. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Jorum and Crane glaciers accelerated twofold in early 2003 and threefold by the end of 2003. In contrast, Flask and Leppard glaciers, further south, did not accelerate as they are still buttressed by an ice shelf. The mass loss associated with the flow acceleration exceeds 27 km3 per year, and ice is thinning at rates of tens of meters per year. We attribute this abrupt evolution of the glaciers to the removal of the buttressing ice shelf.

  abstract = {Iceberg calving has been assumed to be the dominant cause of mass loss for the Antarctic ice sheet, with previous estimates of the calving flux exceeding 2,000 gigatonnes per year. More recently, the importance of melting by the ocean has been demonstrated close to the grounding line and near the calving front. So far, however, no study has reliably quantified the calving flux and the basal mass balance (the balance between accretion and ablation at the ice-shelf base) for the whole of Antarctica. The distribution of fresh water in the Southern Ocean and its partitioning between the liquid and solid phases is therefore poorly constrained. Here we estimate the mass balance components for all ice shelves in Antarctica, using satellite measurements of calving flux and grounding-line flux, modelled ice-shelf snow accumulation rates and a regional scaling that accounts for unsurveyed areas. We obtain a total calving flux of 1,321 \ensuremath{\pm} 144 gigatonnes per year and a total basal mass balance of -1,454 \ensuremath{\pm} 174 gigatonnes per year. This means that about half of the ice-sheet surface mass gain is lost through oceanic erosion before reaching the ice front, and the calving flux is about 34 per cent less than previous estimates derived from iceberg tracking. In addition, the fraction of mass loss due to basal processes varies from about 10 to 90 per cent between ice shelves. We find a significant positive correlation between basal mass loss and surface elevation change for ice shelves experiencing surface lowering and enhanced discharge. We suggest that basal mass loss is a valuable metric for predicting future ice-shelf vulnerability to oceanic forcing.},

To date, measurements of the area of ice shelves on the AP have either been approximated, or calculated for individual shelves over dissimilar time intervals. Here we present a new dataset containing up-to-date and consistent area calculations for each of the twelve ice shelves on the AP over the past five decades. The results reveal an overall reduction in total ice-shelf area by over 28 000 km(2) since the beginning of the period. Individual ice shelves show different rates of retreat, ranging from slow but progressive retreat to abrupt collapse. We discuss the pertinent features of each ice shelf and also broad spatial and temporal patterns in the timing and rate of retreat. We believe that an understanding of this diversity and what it implies about the underlying dynamics and control will provide the best foundation for developing a reliable predictive skill for ice-shelf change.},

  abstract = {In this paper, several techniques to improve the processing and analysis of decadal elevation-change time series (ECTS) constructed using satellite radar altimeter data over the Antarctic ice sheet are described. First, a method that improves both the quality and quantity of ice-sheet ECTS is introduced. By dynamically selecting the reference month used in constructing ECTS for a given local region, the maximum number of elevation-change estimates are used in a matrix processing technique. This can improve ECTS quality while also generating ECTS in new areas, leading to a significant increase in spatial coverage. Next, an improved autoregressive (IAR) approach is presented for modeling nonlinear medium-period variations in decadal Antarctic ECTS. This builds upon previous work where an AR model was used to characterize seasonal and interannual variations in ice-sheet ECTS. The improved approach avoids overdecomposition by adopting an iterative local average filter to estimate nonlinear medium-period trends. Monte Carlo simulations show that the IAR method significantly outperforms the AR method when realistic nonlinear trends are present. Because of these characteristics, the IAR model is able to adequately characterize seasonal, interannual, and medium-period nonlinear signals present in decadal ECTS and extract their long-term trends with very small error. This is important for accurate measurement of decadal elevation change over the Antarctic ice sheet and for assessing the impact of these changes on the global sea level},

  abstract = {We use data acquired between 1978 and 2008 by four satellite radar altimeter missions (Seasat, ERS-1, ERS-2 and Envisat) to determine multidecadal elevation change rates (dhi/dt) for six major Antarctic Peninsula (AP) ice shelves. In areas covered by the Seasat orbit (to 72.16{\textdegree}S), regional-averaged 30-year trends were negative (surface lowering), with rates between -0.03 and -0.16 m a-1. Surface lowering preceded the start of near-continuous radar altimeter operations that began with ERS-1 in 1992. The average rate of lowering for the first 14 years of the period was typically smaller than the 30-year average; the exception was the southern Wilkins Ice Shelf, which experienced negligible lowering between 2000 and 2008, when a series of large calving events began. Analyses of the continuous ERS/Envisat time series (to 81.5{\textdegree}) for 1992{\textendash}2008 reveal a period of strong negative dhi/dt on most ice shelves between 1992 and 1995. Based on prior studies of regional atmospheric and oceanic conditions, we hypothesize that the observed elevation changes on Larsen C Ice Shelf are driven primarily by firn compaction while the western AP ice shelves are responding to changes in both surface mass balance and basal melt rates. Our time series also show that large changes in dhi/dt can occur on interannual time scales, reinforcing the importance of long time series altimetry to separate long-term trends associated with climate change from interannual to interdecadal natural variability.},

  abstract = {We have reprocessed ERS-1 radar altimeter waveforms using an algorithm designed to minimize sea surface slope error and decouple it from significant wave height (SWH) error. Standard waveform retracking estimates three parameters-arrival time, SWH and amplitude. We show that errors in retracked estimates of arrival time and SWH are inherently correlated because of the noise characteristics of the returned waveform. This suggests that some of what is called 'sea state bias' in the literature may be caused by correlated errors rather than true electromagnetic or skewness bias. We have developed a retracking algorithm that reduces this error correlation and makes the resolution of sea surface slope signals independent of sea state. The main assumption is that the SWH varies smoothly along the satellite track over wavelengths of 90 km. This approach reduces the rms error in sea surface slope to only 62 per cent of that of standard retracking methods. While our method is optimized for gravity field recovery, it may also improve the resolution of sea surface height signals of interest to physical oceanographers.},

  abstract = {The air content of glacial firn determines the effect and attribution of observed changes in ice surface elevation, but is currently measurable only using labor-intensive ground-based techniques. Here a novel method is presented for using radar sounding measurements to decompose the total thickness of floating ice shelves into thicknesses of solid ice and firn air (or firn water). The method is applied to a 1997/98 airborne survey of Larsen Ice Shelf, revealing large spatial gradients in air content that are consistent with existing measurements and local meteorology. The gradients appear to be governed by meltwater-induced firn densification. We find sufficient air in Larsen C Ice Shelf for increased densification to account for its previously observed surface lowering, and the rate of lowering superficially agrees with published trends in melting. This does not preclude a contribution to the lowering from oceanic basal melting, but a modern repeat of the survey could conclusively distinguish atmosphere-led from ocean-led change. The technique also holds promise for the calibration of firn-density models, derivation of ice thickness from surface elevation measurements, and calculation of the sea-level contribution of changes in grounded-ice discharge.},

Basal melt of 1325 \ensuremath{\pm} 235 gigatons per year (Gt/year) exceeds a calving flux of 1089 \ensuremath{\pm} 139 Gt/year, making ice-shelf melting the largest ablation process in Antarctica. The giant cold-cavity Ross, Filchner, and Ronne ice shelves covering two-thirds of the total ice-shelf area account for only 15\% of net melting. Half of the meltwater comes from 10 small, warm-cavity Southeast Pacific ice shelves occupying 8\% of the area. A similar high melt/area ratio is found for six East Antarctic ice shelves, implying undocumented strong ocean thermal forcing on their deep grounding lines.
Major Meltdown
The ice shelves and floating ice tongues that surround Antarctica cover more than 1.5 million square kilometers{\textemdash}approximately the size of the entire Greenland Ice Sheet. Conventional wisdom has held that ice shelves around Antarctica lose mass mostly by iceberg calving, but recently it has become increasingly clear that melting by a warming ocean may also be important. Rignot et al.

The grounded ice boundary is 53 610 km long; 74\% of it abuts to floating ice shelves or outlet glaciers, 19\% is adjacent to open or sea-ice covered ocean, and 7\% of the boundary are land terminations with bare rock. Elevations along each line are selected from 6 candidate digital elevation models: two created from the input ICESat laser altimetry and Landsat data, two from stereo satellite imagery, and two from compilations of primarily radar altimetry. Elevation selection and an assignment of confidence in the elevation value are based on agreement with ICESat elevation values and shape of the surface inferred from the Landsat imagery. Elevations along the freely-floating boundary (called the hydrostatic line) are converted to ice thicknesses by applying a firn-correction factor and a flotation criterion. The relationship between the seaward offset of the hydrostatic line from the grounding line only weakly matches a prediction based on beam theory. Airborne data are used to validate the technique of grounding line mapping, elevation selection and ice thickness derivation. The mapped products along with the customized software to generate them and a variety of intermediate products are available from the National Snow and Ice Data Center.},

  abstract = {Introduction
George VI Ice Shelf, sandwiched between the western coast of Palmer Land and the eastern coast of Alexander Island, is the largest and most studied of the west Antarctic
Peninsula ice shelves. It covers an area of approximately 25,000 km2 and is underlain by Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), with temperatures in excess of 1{\textordmasculine}C, giving rise to rapid basal melting (Bishop and Walton, 1981; Lennon et al., 1982). The maximum ice thickness of about 500 m occurs about 70 km from the southern ice front, where a ridge of thick ice extends across George VI Sound (near 70{\textordmasculine}W, see Figure 1) effectively dividing the upper water column into northern and southern regions. The northern ice front, which faces Marguerite Bay, appears to be near the geographical limit of ice shelf viability and has
undergone a gradual retreat in recent decades (Lucchitta and Rosanova, 1998), a timeframe over which much of the nearby Wordie Ice Shelf disintegrated (Doake and Vaughan, 1991). There is extensive surface melting over the northern parts of the ice shelf and much of the ice column near the northern ice front appears to be temperate (Paren and Cooper, 1986). Conditions in the south, where the ice front faces into Ronne Entrance, are colder and the ice
front position appears to be steady. The vast majority of the flow into the ice shelf comes from Palmer Land, but basal melting is sufficient to remove most of this, so that the ice is derived almost exclusively from local accumulation by the time it reaches the ice fronts
(Potter et al., 1984). There is some evidence at the margins of the ice shelf to suggest that it may have disappeared completely during the early Holocene before reforming (Sugden and Clapperton, 1981; Bentley et al., 2005).},

The 300 Gt/year range is approximately 15\% of the annual mass input and 0.8 mm/year Sea Level Equivalent (SLE). Two estimates from radar altimeter measurements of elevation change by European Remote-sensing Satellites (ERS) (+28 and -31 Gt/year) lie in the upper part, whereas estimates from the Input-minus-Output Method (IOM) and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) lie in the lower part (-40 to -246 Gt/year). We compare the various estimates, discuss the methodology used, and critically assess the results. We also modify the IOM estimate using (1) an alternate extrapolation to estimate the discharge from the non-observed 15\% of the periphery, and (2) substitution of input from a field data compilation for input from an atmospheric model in 6\% of area. The modified IOM estimate reduces the loss from 136 Gt/year to 13 Gt/year. Two ERS-based estimates, the modified IOM, and a GRACE-based estimate for observations within 1992-2005 lie in a narrowed range of +27 to -40 Gt/year, which is about 3\% of the annual mass input and only 0.2 mm/year SLE. Our preferred estimate for 1992-2001 is -47 Gt/year for West Antarctica, +16 Gt/year for East Antarctica, and -31 Gt/year overall (+0.1 mm/year SLE), not including part of the Antarctic Peninsula (1.07\% of the AIS area). Although recent reports of large and increasing rates of mass loss with time from GRACE-based studies cite agreement with IOM results, our evaluation does not support that conclusion.},

Thinning of an ice shelf reduces this effect, leading to an increase in ice discharge to the ocean. Using 18 years of continuous satellite radar altimeter observations, we have computed decadal-scale changes in ice-shelf thickness around the Antarctic continent. Overall, average ice-shelf volume change accelerated from negligible loss at 25 \ensuremath{\pm} 64 cubic kilometers per year for 1994{\textendash}2003 to rapid loss of 310 \ensuremath{\pm} 74 cubic kilometers per year for 2003{\textendash}2012. West Antarctic losses increased by {\textasciitilde}70\% in the past decade, and earlier volume gain by East Antarctic ice shelves ceased. In the Amundsen and Bellingshausen regions, some ice shelves have lost up to 18\% of their thickness in less than two decades.
Disappearing faster around the edges
The floating ice shelves around Antarctica, which buttress ice streams from the continent and slow their discharge into the sea, are thinning at faster rates. Paolo et al. present satellite data showing that ice shelves in many regions around the edge of the continent are losing mass. This result increases concern about how fast sea level might rise as climate continues to warm. If warming continues to cause ice shelves to thin, as they have for the past couple of decades, their disappearance may allow land-based ice to collapse and melt.

These glaciers thin both at the surface, from warm air temperatures, and along their submerged faces in contact with warm ocean waters(8). Little is known about the rates of submarine melting(9-11) and how they may affect glacier dynamics. Here we present measurements of ocean currents, temperature and salinity near the calving fronts of the Eqip Sermia, Kangilerngata Sermia, Sermeq Kujatdleq and Sermeq Avangnardleq glaciers in central West Greenland, as well as ice-front bathymetry and geographical positions. We calculate water-mass and heat budgets that reveal summer submarine melt rates ranging from 0.7 +/- 0.2 to 3.9 +/- 0.8 m d(-1). These rates of submarine melting are two orders of magnitude larger than surface melt rates, but comparable to rates of iceberg discharge. We conclude that ocean waters melt a considerable, but highly variable, fraction of the calving fronts of glaciers before they disintegrate into icebergs, and suggest that submarine melting must have a profound influence on grounding-line stability and ice-flow dynamics.},

  abstract = {Thinning ice in West Antarctica, resulting from acceleration in the flow of outlet glaciers, is at present contributing about 10\% of the observed rise in global sea level1. Pine Island Glacier in particular has shown nearly continuous acceleration2, 3 and thinning4, 5, throughout the short observational record. The floating ice shelf that forms where the glacier reaches the coast has been thinning rapidly6, driven by changes in ocean heat transport beneath it. As a result, the line that separates grounded and floating ice has retreated inland7. These events have been postulated as the cause for the inland thinning and acceleration8, 9. Here we report evidence gathered by an autonomous underwater vehicle operating beneath the ice shelf that Pine Island Glacier was recently grounded on a transverse ridge in the sea floor. Warm sea water now flows through a widening gap above the submarine ridge, rapidly melting the thick ice of the newly formed upstream half of the ice shelf. The present evolution of Pine Island Glacier is thus part of a longer-term trend that has moved the downstream limit of grounded ice inland by 30\hspace{0.167em}km, into water that is 300\hspace{0.167em}m deeper than over the ridge crest. The pace and ultimate extent of such potentially unstable retreat10 are central to the debate over the possibility of widespread ice-sheet collapse triggered by climate change},

As the uplift and subsidence features correspond to sites at which the basal water apparently experiences a hydraulic potential well, we suggest transient movement of pockets of subglacial water as the most likely cause for the vertical surface displacements.

Altimeter crossovers are used very effectively as additional tracking data to laser ranging. The ERS Tandem Mission even provides the unique possibility to simultaneously determine orbits of two similar satellites flying the same orbit. Altimeter crossovers between the two satellites then link the two orbits into a common reference frame. Tailoring of the Joint Gravity Model 3 (JGM 3) is another step to reduce orbit errors. This technique is aimed at the reduction of the geographically anticorrelated orbit error (observed in the crossover height differences) through the adjustment of selected gravity field parameters. The resulting Delft Gravity Model (DGM)-E04 has reduced this part of the orbit error by a factor of 2, performs even better with respect to the ESA-provided orbits, and also outperforms the recent Earth Geopotential Model EGM96 in this respect. ERS-1 and ERS-2 orbits for the entire Tandem Mission are computed and studied in detail, and orbit errors due to the gravity field and nonconservative forces are identified. Analyses systematically show that the orbits computed with JGM 3 have a radial root-mean-square orbit accuracy of 7 cm, with DGM-E04 5 cm.},

  abstract = {The catastrophic collapses of Larsen A and B ice shelves on the eastern Antarctic Peninsula have caused their tributary glaciers to accelerate, contributing to sea-level rise and freshening the Antarctic Bottom Water formed nearby. The surface of Larsen C Ice Shelf (LCIS), the largest ice shelf on the peninsula, is lowering. This could be caused by unbalanced ocean melting (ice loss) or enhanced firn melting and compaction (englacial air loss). Using a novel method to analyse eight radar surveys, this study derives separate estimates of ice and air thickness changes during a 15 year period. The uncertainties are considerable, but the primary estimate is that the surveyed lowering (0.066 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.017 m yr-1) is caused by both ice loss (0.28 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.18 m yr-1) and firn air loss (0.037 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.026 m yr-1). Though the ice loss is much larger, ice and air loss contribute approximately equally to the lowering. The ice loss could be explained by high basal melting and/or ice divergence, and the air loss by low surface accumulation or high surface melting and/or compaction. The primary estimate therefore requires that at least two forcings caused the surveyed lowering.  Mechanisms are discussed by which LCIS stability could be compromised in future, suggesting destabilisation timescales of a few centuries. The most rapid pathways to collapse are offered by a flow perturbation arising from the ungrounding of LCIS from Bawden Ice Rise, or ice-front retreat past a "compressive arch" in strain rates.},

Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone.

Here we detail the interaction of modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) with the Amery Ice Shelf, the largest ice shelf in East Antarctica, and provide the first estimates of basal melting due to mCDW. We use subice shelf ocean observations from a borehole site (AM02) situated \ensuremath{\sim}70 km inshore of the ice shelf front, together with open ocean observations in Prydz Bay. We find that mCDW transport into the cavity is about 0.22\hspace{0.167em}\ensuremath{\pm}\hspace{0.167em}0.06 Sv (1 Sv\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}106 m3 s-1).

The heat content flux by mCDW at AM02 shows high intra-annual variability (up to 40\%). Our results suggest two main modes of subice shelf circulation and basal melt regimes: (1) the ``ice pump''/high salinity shelf water circulation, on the western flank and (2) the mCDW meltwater-driven circulation in conjunction with the ``ice pump,'' on the eastern flank. These results highlight the sensitivity of the Amery's basal melting to changes in mCDW inflow. Improved understanding of such ice shelf-ocean interaction is crucial to refining projections of mass loss and associated sea level rise.},

The two repeat-track methods yield similar results and compare well to the more accurate, but sparsely sampled, crossover points. Most glacier regions in Svalbard have experienced low-elevation thinning combined with high-elevation balance or thickening during 2003-2008. The geodetic mass balance (excluding calving front retreat or advance) of Svalbard's 34,600km2 glaciers is estimated to be -4.3??1.4 Gt y-1, corresponding to an area-averaged water equivalent (w.e.) balance of -0.12??0.04m w.e. y-1. The largest ice losses have occurred in the west and south, while northeastern Spitsbergen and the Austfonna ice cap have gained mass. Winter and summer elevation changes derived from the same methods indicate that the spatial gradient in mass balance is mainly due to a larger summer season thinning in the west and the south than in the northeast. Our findings are consistent with in-situ mass balance measurements from the same period, confirming that repeat-track satellite altimetry can be a valuable tool for monitoring short term elevation changes of Arctic glaciers. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

An integral for the impulse response is given, and analytic forms for the special cases of a mispointed circular antenna and a nadir-pointed elliptical antenna are derived. An analytic approximation for the case of small ellipticity and small surface gradient (or mispointing) are also given. The letter is illustrated with numerical examples that show the general effect of ellipticity on the impulse response. It also shows that in the practical case of the elliptical CryoSat-2 satellite SIRAL antenna, the analytic approximation is sufficiently accurate to provide a correction for the ellipticity for CryoSat-2 echoes from the ocean surface.},

  abstract = {The breakup of ice shelves has been widely regarded as an indicator of climate change(1), with observations around the Antarctic Peninsula having shown a pattern of gradual retreat, associated with regional atmospheric warming-and increased summer melt and fracturing processes(2-9). The rapid collapse of the northernmost section of the Larsen Ice Shelf (Larsen A), over a few days in January 1995, indicated that, after retreat beyond a critical limit, ice shelves may disintegrate rapidly. Here we use a finite-element numerical model that treats ice as a continuum without fracture(10) to examine the breakup history(2) between 1986 and 1997 of the two northern sections of Larsen Ice Shelf (Larsen A and Larsen B), from which we establish stability criteria for ice shelves. Analysis of various ice-shelf configurations reveals characteristic patterns in the strain rates near the ice front which we use to describe the stability of the ice shelf. On Larsen A, only the initial and final ice-front configurations show a stable pattern. Larsen B at present exhibits a stable pattern, hut if the ice front were to retreat by a further Few kilometres, it too is Likely to enter an irreversible retreat phase.},

The surface elevations were obtained from computer retracking of the radar altimeter waveforms, which were recorded at 0.1-s intervals corresponding to 662-m spacings on the surface. The precision of the elevation measurements before adjustment for radial orbit errors is 1.9 m as shown by analysis of elevation differences at orbital crossover points. This precision is partly determined by radial errors of approximately 1.0 m in orbit determination and partly by noise due to ice surface irregularities. Adjustment of the radial components of the orbits to minimize the differences in elevations at crossovers over a small, relatively flat region reduces the rms difference to 0.25 m, which is indicative of the optimum precision obtainable over the ice sheets. However, the precision degrades as the slope of the surface or amplitude of the undulations increases, yielding an overall precision of \ensuremath{\pm}1.6 m. The preliminary contour maps are not corrected for slope-induced displacements. A 2-m contour map in a region of highest data density illustrates the three-dimensional characteristics of some surface undulations.},

Seismic surveys and investigations through boreholes have revealed a spatial association between fast ice flow and saturated deformable sediments. Nevertheless, our knowledge of the morphology of the interface between ice and sediments is still limited, resulting in only rudimentary understanding of the basal boundary conditions beneath ice streams and the generation of subglacial bedforms. Here we present radar data from the bed of a West Antarctic ice stream that reveal the presence of mega-scale glacial lineations. We combine these data with previously published seismic data and show that these lineations develop in areas of dilatant deforming till and are part of a dynamic sedimentary system that undergoes significant change by erosion and deposition on decadal timescales. We find that the mega-scale glacial lineations are indistinguishable from those found on beds of palaeo-ice streams, providing conclusive evidence for the hypothesis that highly elongate bedforms are a characteristic of fast-flow regions in ice sheets.},

  doi = {10.1029/2010JB008073},
  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that postseismic relaxation following the 2004 Mw6.0 Parkfield, CA, earthquake is dominated by afterslip. However, we show that some fraction of the afterslip inferred from kinematic inversion to have occurred immediately below the seismically ruptured area may in fact be a substitute for viscous postseismic deformation of the lower crust. Using continuous GPS and synthetic aperture radar interferometry, we estimate the relative contribution of shallow afterslip (at depth less than 20km) and deeper seated deformation required to account for observed postseismic surface displacements. Exploiting the possible separation in space and time of the time series of displacements predicted from viscoelastic relaxation, we devise a linear inversion scheme that allows inverting jointly for the contribution of afterslip and viscoelastic flow as a function of time. We find that a wide range of models involving variable amounts of viscoelastic deformation can fit the observations equally well provided that they allow some fraction of deep-seated deformation (at depth larger than \ensuremath{\sim}20 km). These models require that the moment released by postseismic relaxation over 5 years following the earthquake reached nearly as much as 200\% of the coseismic moment. All the models show a remarkable complementarity of coseismic and shallow afterslip distributions. Some significant deformation at lower crustal depth (20{\textendash}26 km) is required to fit the geodetic data. The condition that postseismic deformation cannot exceed complete relaxation places a constraint on the amount of deep seated deformation. The analysis requires an effective viscosity of at least \ensuremath{\sim}1018 Pa s of the lower crust (assuming a semi-infinite homogeneous viscous domain). This deep-seated deformation is consistent with the depth range of tremors which also show a transient postseismic response and could explain as much as 50\% of the total postseismic geodetic moment (the remaining fraction being due to afterslip at depth shallower than 20 km). Lower crustal postseismic deformation could reflect a combination of localized ductile deformation and aseismic frictional sliding.},

several ice shelves there. The rapid loss of 3320 km2 from the northern Larsen B
ice shelf in early 2002 typifies the pattern and pace of these events. Extended melt
seasons leading to melt ponding on the shelf surfaces are the apparent cause of the
breakups. Enhanced fracturing of pre-existing crevasses and shelf rifts driven by
this meltwater occurs during warmer summers, leading to disintegration. Shelf
breakups in the Peninsula over the last 20 years, coupled with geological evidence
of their prior stability over the previous several millennia, imply that Peninsula
climate is warmer now than at any time during this period. Stability of the remaining
Peninsula shelves and other ice shelves can be assessed using remotely sensed
indicators based on the presented model of ice shelf breakup. We find that, among
11 Antarctic ice shelves fringing the continent, only the currently retreating
Larsen B, Wilkins, and George VI ice shelves, and the northernmost portions of
the Larsen C shelf (northeast of the Alexander Peninsula) have the firn characteristics

Recent observations establish a clear correspondence between the increased delivery of oceanic heat to the ice-sheet margin and increased ice loss. In Antarctica, most of these processes are reasonably well understood but have not been rigorously quantified. In Greenland, an understanding of the processes by which warmer ocean temperatures drive the observed retreat remains elusive. Experiments designed to identify the relevant processes are confounded by the logistical difficulties of instrumenting ice-choked fjords with actively calving glaciers. For both ice sheets, multiple challenges remain before the fully coupled ice-ocean-atmosphere models needed for rigorous sea-level projection are available.},

  abstract = {{[}1{]} Contrary to popular belief, the melting of floating ice (in the form of ice shelves, icebergs and sea ice) may have a non-zero impact on sea level. This is because the melting process cools and dilutes the oceans on average, and unless these opposing effects exactly balance each other there will be a net change in the ocean density. We discuss how these subtle effects can be quantified and put bounds on the potential sea level rise associated with melting of the ice masses that are currently afloat in the world's oceans.},

  abstract = {Abstract TOPEX/Poseidon satellite altimeter data are used to estimate global empirical orthogonal functions that are then combined with historical tide gauge data to estimate monthly distributions of large-scale sea level variability and change over the period 1950{\textendash}2000. The reconstruction is an attempt to narrow the current broad range of sea level rise estimates, to identify any pattern of regional sea level rise, and to determine any variation in the rate of sea level rise over the 51-yr period. The computed rate of global-averaged sea level rise from the reconstructed monthly time series is 1.8 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.3 mm yr-1. With the decadal variability in the computed global mean sea level, it is not possible to detect a significant increase in the rate of sea level rise over the period 1950{\textendash}2000. A regional pattern of sea level rise is identified. The maximum sea level rise is in the eastern off-equatorial Pacific and there is a minimum along the equator, in the western Pacific, and in the eastern Indian Ocean. A greater rate of sea level rise on the eastern North American coast compared with the United Kingdom and the Scandinavian peninsula is also found. The major sources of uncertainty are the inadequate historical distribution of tide gauges, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere, inadequate information on tide gauge signals from processes such as postglacial rebound and tectonic activity, and the short satellite altimeter record available to estimate global sea level covariance functions. The results demonstrate that tide gauge records will continue to complement satellite altimeter records for observing and understanding sea level change.},

The west Antarctic ice sheet had a five-year trend of -3.6\&plusmn;1.0 cm/year due largely to strong negative trends of around 10 cm/year for basins in Marie Byrd Land along the Pacific sector of the Antarctic coast.

Cross-mission crossover analysis between time-coincident ERS-2-, Envisat-, and ICESat-retrieved elevations and comparisons to an ICESat-derived digital elevation map are used to quantify the radar elevation error budget as a function of surface slope and to investigate the effectiveness of a method to account for the radar altimeter slope-induced error. The precision and accuracy of the elevations retrieved from the ICESat Geoscience Laser Altimeter System and the European Space Agency radar altimeters on ERS-2 and Envisat are calculated over the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets using a crossover analysis. As a result of this work, the laser precision is found to vary as a function of surface slope from 14 to 59 cm, and the radar precision varies from 59 cm to 3.7 m for ERS-2 and from 28 cm to 2.06 m for Envisat.

The AR model can be used in conjunction with weighted least squares regression to accurately estimate any longer term linear trend present in the cyclically varying elevation change time series. This approach is robust in that it can account for seasonal and interannual elevation change variations, missing points in the time series, signal aperiodicity, time series heteroscedasticity, and time series with a noninteger number of yearly cycles. In addition, we derive a theoretically valid estimate of the uncertainty (standard error) in the long-term linear trend. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted that closely emulated actual characteristics of five-year elevation change time series from Antarctica. The Monte Carlo results indicate that the autoregressive approach yields long-term linear trends that are less biased than two other approaches that have been recently used for analysis of ice sheet elevation change time series. In addition, the simulation results demonstrate that the variability (uncertainty) of the long-term linear trend estimates from the AR approach is in very good agreement with the derived theoretical standard error estimates.},

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of global sea-level rise requires that we understand the cause of recent, widespread and intensifying glacier acceleration along Antarctic ice-sheet coastal margins. Atmospheric and oceanic forcing have the potential to reduce the thickness and extent of floating ice shelves, potentially limiting their ability to buttress the flow of grounded tributary glaciers. Indeed, recent ice-shelf collapse led to retreat and acceleration of several glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula. But the extent and magnitude of ice-shelf thickness change, the underlying causes of such change, and its link to glacier flow rate are so poorly understood that its future impact on the ice sheets cannot yet be predicted. Here we use satellite laser altimetry and modelling of the surface firn layer to reveal the circum-Antarctic pattern of ice-shelf thinning through increased basal melt. We deduce that this increased melt is the primary control of Antarctic ice-sheet loss, through a reduction in buttressing of the adjacent ice sheet leading to accelerated glacier flow. The highest thinning rates occur where warm water at depth can access thick ice shelves via submarine troughs crossing the continental shelf. Wind forcing could explain the dominant patterns of both basal melting and the surface melting and collapse of Antarctic ice shelves, through ocean upwelling in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen seas, and atmospheric warming on the Antarctic Peninsula. This implies that climate forcing through changing winds influences Antarctic ice-sheet mass balance, and hence global sea level, on annual to decadal timescales.},

  abstract = {In 1994, ocean measurements near Antarctica's Pine Island Glacier showed that the ice shelf buttressing the glacier was melting rapidly1. This melting was attributed to the presence of relatively warm, deep water on the Amundsen Sea continental shelf. Heat, salt and ice budgets along with ocean modelling provided steady-state calving and melting rates2, 3. Subsequent satellite observations and modelling have indicated large system imbalances, including ice-shelf thinning and more intense melting, glacier acceleration and drainage basin drawdown4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Here we combine our earlier data with measurements taken in 2009 to show that the temperature and volume of deep water in Pine Island Bay have increased. Ocean transport and tracer calculations near the ice shelf reveal a rise in meltwater production by about 50\% since 1994. The faster melting seems to result mainly from stronger sub-ice-shelf circulation, as thinning ice has increased the gap above an underlying submarine bank on which the glacier was formerly grounded11. We conclude that the basal melting has exceeded the increase in ice inflow, leading to the formation and enlargement of an inner cavity under the ice shelf within which sea water nearly 4 {\textdegree}C above freezing can now more readily access the grounding zone.},

  abstract = {Abstract A computationally efficient relocatable system for generalized inverse (GI) modeling of barotropic ocean tides is described. The GI penalty functional is minimized using a representer method, which requires repeated solution of the forward and adjoint linearized shallow water equations (SWEs). To make representer computations efficient, the SWEs are solved in the frequency domain by factoring the coefficient matrix for a finite-difference discretization of the second-order wave equation in elevation. Once this matrix is factored representers can be calculated rapidly. By retaining the first-order SWE system (defined in terms of both elevations and currents) in the definition of the discretized GI penalty functional, complete generality in the choice of dynamical error covariances is retained. This allows rational assumptions about errors in the SWE, with soft momentum balance constraints (e.g., to account for inaccurate parameterization of dissipation), but holds mass conservation constraints. While the dynamical calculations involve elevations alone, depth-averaged currents can be directly assimilated into the tidal model with this approach. The efficient representer calculation forms the basis for the Oregon State University (OSU) Tidal Inversion Software (OTIS). OTIS includes software for generating grids, prior model covariances, and boundary conditions; for time stepping the nonlinear shallow water equations to generate a first guess or prior solution; for preliminary processing of TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter data; for solution of the GI problem; and for computation of posterior error bars. Approximate GI solution methods, based on using a reduced set of representers, allow very large datasets to be inverted. OTIS regional and local GI tidal modeling (with grids containing up to 105 nodes) require only a few hours on a common desktop workstation. Use of OTIS is illustrated by developing a new regional-scale (1/6{\textdegree}) model of tides in the Indonesian Seas.},

  abstract = {Many glaciers along the margins of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are accelerating and, for this reason, contribute increasingly to global sea-level rise. Globally, ice losses contribute approximately 1.8 mm yr(-1) (ref. 8), but this could increase if the retreat of ice shelves and tidewater glaciers further enhances the loss of grounded ice or initiates the large-scale collapse of vulnerable parts of the ice sheets. Ice loss as a result of accelerated flow, known as dynamic thinning, is so poorly understood that its potential contribution to sea level over the twenty-first century remains unpredictable. Thinning on the ice-sheet scale has been monitored by using repeat satellite altimetry observations to track small changes in surface elevation, but previous sensors could not resolve most fast-flowing coastal glaciers. Here we report the use of high-resolution ICESat (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite) laser altimetry to map change along the entire grounded margins of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. To isolate the dynamic signal, we compare rates of elevation change from both fast-flowing and slow-flowing ice with those expected from surface mass-balance fluctuations. We find that dynamic thinning of glaciers now reaches all latitudes in Greenland, has intensified on key Antarctic grounding lines, has endured for decades after ice-shelf collapse, penetrates far into the interior of each ice sheet and is spreading as ice shelves thin by ocean-driven melt. In Greenland, glaciers flowing faster than 100 m yr(-1) thinned at an average rate of 0.84 m yr(-1), and in the Amundsen Sea embayment of Antarctica, thinning exceeded 9.0 m yr(-1) for some glaciers. Our results show that the most profound changes in the ice sheets currently result from glacier dynamics at ocean margins.},

Velocity increase probably resulted from decreased buttressing from thinning (and, for JI, breakup) of their floating ice tongues, and from reduced basal drag as grounding lines on both glaciers retreat. JI flows directly into the ocean as it becomes afloat, and here creep rates are proportional to the cube of bed depth. Rapid thinning of the PIG ice shelf increases the likelihood of its breakup, and subsequent rapid increase in discharge velocity. Results from a simple model indicate that JI velocities should almost double to \ensuremath{>}20 km a1 by 2015, with velocities on PIG increasing to \ensuremath{>}10 km a1 after breakup of its ice shelf. These high velocities would probably be sustained over many decades as the glaciers retreat within their long, very deep troughs. Resulting sea-level rise would average about 1.5 mm a1.},

  abstract = {Abstract Objective analysis of altimetric data (sea level anomaly) usually assumes that measurement errors are well represented by a white noise, though there are long-wavelength errors that are correlated over thousands of kilometers along the satellite tracks. These errors are typically 3 cm rms for TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P), which is not negligible in low-energy regions. Analyzing maps produced by conventional objective analysis thus reveals residual long-wavelength errors in the form of tracks on the maps. These errors induce sea level gradients perpendicular to the track and, therefore, high geostrophic velocities that can obscure ocean features. To overcome this problem, an improved objective analysis method that takes into account along-track correlated errors is developed. A specific data selection is used to allow an efficient correction of long-wavelength errors while estimating the oceanic signal. The influence of data selection is analyzed, and the method is first tested with simulated data. The method is then applied to real T/P and ERS-1 data in the Canary Basin (a region typical of low eddy energy regions), and the results are compared to those of a conventional objective analysis method. The correction for the along-track long-wavelength error has a very significant effect. For T/P and ERS-1 separately, the mapping difference between the two methods is about 2 cm rms (20\% of the signal variance). The variance of the difference in zonal and meridional velocities is roughly 30\% and 60\%, respectively, of the velocity signal variance. The effect is larger when T/P and ERS-1 are combined. Correcting the long-wavelength error also considerably improves the consistency between the T/P and ERS-1 datasets. The variance of the difference (T/P{\textendash}ERS-1) is reduced by a factor of 1.7 for the sea level, 1.6 for zonal velocities, and 2.3 for meridional velocities. The method is finally applied globally to T/P data. It is shown that it is tractable at the global scale and that it provides an improved mapping.},

Satellite remote-sensing data of ice elevations and ice motion show significant ice loss in the range of -31 to -196 Gt yr-1 in West Antarctica in recent years1, 2, 3, 4, whereas East Antarctica seems to remain in balance or slightly gain mass1, 2, 4, with estimated rates of mass change in the range of -4 to 22 Gt yr-1. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment5 (GRACE) offers the opportunity of quantifying polar ice-sheet mass balance from a different perspective6, 7. Here we use an extended record of GRACE data spanning the period April 2002 to January 2009 to quantify the rates of Antarctic ice loss. In agreement with an independent earlier assessment4, we estimate a total loss of 190\ensuremath{\pm}77 Gt yr-1, with 132\ensuremath{\pm}26 Gt yr-1 coming from West Antarctica. However, in contrast with previous GRACE estimates, our data suggest that East Antarctica is losing mass, mostly in coastal regions, at a rate of -57\ensuremath{\pm}52 Gt yr-1, apparently caused by increased ice loss since the year 2006.},

The East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) rests on ground that is mostly above sea level, and the overlying ice has been considered stable over long time periods (Alley Whillans, 1984) because it is relatively isolated from climatic perturbations. In contrast, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) rests on ground that is predominantly below sea level, and its configuration is considered unstable due to the inland-sloping bedrock geometry, a heightened exposure to oceanic perturbations, and the presence of deformable sediments beneath major outlet glaciers (Alley Whillans, 1991). Here, we determine the volume change of Antarctic outlet glaciers between 1992 and 2003 to characterise the ice sheet mass balance. We conclude that only glaciers of a certain geometry-those seated in submarine basins with no substantial ice shelf barrier-are losing mass today. These glaciers are sited in both East and West Antarctica and, because they are susceptible to changes in climate, we anticipate they will provide a substantial contribution to global sea levels over the twenty-first century should ocean warming continue as projected (Gille, 2002).},

The products are derived from MODIS band 1 (red light: \ensuremath{\sim} 647 nm) and band 2 (infrared: \ensuremath{\sim} 857 nm) orbit swath data acquired during the 2003{\textendash}2004 austral summer. Multiple images of all areas are combined in a data cumulation scheme to improve spatial resolution and increase radiometric content of the mosaics. The component images were de-striped, geo-registered, and re-sampled to the projection grid using the MODIS Swath-to-Grid Toolbox (MS2GT) software. A 125 m ground-equivalent polar stereographic projection was used, identical to previous radar image mosaics and similar to several other continent-wide data sets. Geo-location accuracy of the final mosaics is better than 125 m. Swath acquisition times were limited to the range 05:00{\textendash}13:30 UT to provide broad but uniform mosaic illumination. Regions of cloud cover, blowing snow, and intense forward scattering were masked prior to compositing. The MOA snow grain size data set image provides the first continent-wide semi-quantitative map of mean summer snow, firn, and blue ice grain size. Optical grain size (radius) was determined using a normalized difference index derived from MODIS band 1 and band 2 rad values. Atmospheric correction, adjustments for directional reflectance variation and snow grain size estimation were accomplished by a look-up table, generated by a combination of published models of snow spectral reflectance and atmosphere radiative transfer. Validation of the snow grain size image is provided by in situ spectra of snow-covered sea ice made in October, 2003.

Satellite laser altimetry from ICESat indicates the surface of Hektoria Glacier lowered by up to 38 � 6 m in a six-month period beginning one year after the break-up in March 2002. Smaller elevation losses are observed for Crane and Jorum glaciers over a later 5-month period. Two glaciers south of the collapse area, Flask and Leppard, show little change in speed or elevation. Seasonal variations in speed preceding the large post-collapse velocity increases suggest that both summer melt percolation and changes in the stress field due to shelf removal play a major role in glacier dynamics.},

We show that the pattern of thinning has both accelerated and spread inland to encompass tributaries flowing into the central trunk of the glacier. Within the 5,400 km(2) central trunk, the average rate of volume loss quadrupled from 2.6 +/- 0.3 km(3) yr(-1) in 1995 to 10.1 +/- 0.3 km(3) yr(-1) in 2006. The region of lightly grounded ice at the glacier terminus is extending upstream, and the changes inland are consistent with the effects of a prolonged disturbance to the ice flow, such as the effects of ocean- driven melting. If the acceleration continues at its present rate, the main trunk of PIG will be afloat within some 100 years, six times sooner than anticipated. Citation: Wingham, D.J., D.W. Wallis, and A.

  abstract = {Ice sheets are expected to shrink in size as the world warms, which in turn will raise sea level. The West Antarctic ice sheet is of particular concern, because it was probably much smaller at times during the past million years when temperatures were comparable to levels that might be reached or exceeded within the next few centuries. Much of the grounded ice in West Antarctica lies on a bed that deepens inland and extends well below sea level. Oceanic and atmospheric warming threaten to reduce or eliminate the floating ice shelves that buttress the ice sheet at present. Loss of the ice shelves would accelerate the flow of non-floating ice near the coast. Because of the slope of the sea bed, the consequent thinning could ultimately float much of the ice sheet's interior. In this scenario, global sea level would rise by more than three metres, at an unknown rate. Simplified analyses suggest that much of the ice sheet will survive beyond this century. We do not know how likely or inevitable eventual collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet is at this stage, but the possibility cannot be discarded. For confident projections of the fate of the ice sheet and the rate of any collapse, further work including the development of well-validated physical models will be required.

We present algorithms for the retrieval of elevation change rates over ice caps using data acquired from these satellites. A comparison of GLAS elevation data to those acquired by the RA-2 shows reasonable agreement between the two instruments; the root mean square elevation change difference was 56 cm, and the correlation coefficient between the two data sets was 0.68. Using only RA-2 elevation measurements, which are spatially and temporally more continuous, we determined the elevation change rate of the areas of the DIC where the surface geometry allows the RA-2 retracker to maintain lock. This includes most of the DIC, excluding large parts of the eastern half of the ice cap. The elevation change rate was found to be insignificant given a statistical estimate of the measurement error \$(-0.09 {\textbackslash}pm 0.29{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}hbox\{m/a\})\$ . We also present an assessment of the regional variations of the DIC elevation change, including a significant \$-0.71 {\textbackslash}pm 0.49{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}hbox\{m/a\}\$ elevation change rate of the 1980-\${\textbackslash}hbox\{km\}\^{}\{2\}\$ western arm.

  abstract = {Around the perimeter of Antarctica, much of the ice sheet discharges to the ocean through floating ice shelves.  The buttressing provided by ice shelves is critical for modulating the flux of ice into the ocean, and the presently observed thinning of ice shelves is believed to be reducing their buttressing capacity and contributing to the acceleration and thinning of the grounded ice sheet.  However, relatively little attention has been paid to the role that fractures play in the ability of ice shelves to sustain and transmit buttressing stresses.  Here, we present a new framework for quantifying the role that fractures play in the creep deformation and buttressing capacity of ice shelves.  We apply principles of continuum damage mechanics to derive a new analytical relation for the creep of an ice shelf that accounts for the softening influence of fractures on longitudinal deformation using a state damage variable.  We use this new analytical relation, combined with a temperature calculation for the ice, to partition an inverse method solution for ice shelf rigidity into independent solutions for softening damage and stabilizing backstress.  Using this new approach, field and remote sensing data can be utilized to monitor the structural integrity of ice shelves, their ability to buttress the flow of ice at the grounding line, and thus their indirect contribution to ice sheet mass balance and global sea level.  We apply this technique to the Larsen C ice shelf using remote sensing and Operation IceBridge data, finding damage in areas with known crevasses and rifts.  Backstress is highest near the grounding line and upstream of ice rises, in agreement with patterns observed on other ice shelves.  The ice in contact with the Bawden ice rise is weakened by fractures, and additional damage or thinning in this area could diminish the backstress transmitted upstream.  We model the consequences for the ice shelf if it loses contact with this small ice rise, finding that flow speeds would increase by 25\% or more over an area the size of the former Larsen B ice shelf.  Such a perturbation could potentially destabilize the northern part of Larsen C along pre-existing lines of weakness, highlighting the importance of the feedback between buttressing and fracturing in an ice shelf.},

Since 2006, high summer melt rates have increased Greenland ice sheet mass loss to 273 gigatons per year (0.75 millimeters per year of equivalent sea level rise).

  abstract = {Using extended satellite gravity measurements from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), here we show that ice losses in southeast Greenland appear to have slowed down dramatically since late 2007, while those in the west, especially northwest Greenland show continued accelerations in recent years. Over the period April 2002 to November 2009, averaged ice loss rates in eastern Greenland (120 +/- 31 Gt/yr) are still significantly larger than those in the west (86.3 +/- 22 Gt/yr). However, the estimated ice loss rate from glaciers in northwest Greenland has increased from 30.9 +/- 8 Gt/yr over the first few years (2002{\textendash}2005) to 128.2 +/- 33 Gt/yr for the more recent period (2007{\textendash}2009), while the loss rate in southeast Greenland for the more recent period has become almost negligible, down from 109 +/- 28 Gt/yr of just a few years ago. The rapid change in the nature of the regional ice mass in southeast and northwest Greenland, in the course of only several years, further reinforces the idea that the Greenland ice sheet mass balance is very vulnerable to regional climate conditions. The dramatic slow down of ice loss in southeast Greenland observed by GRACE provides an independent verification of similar reports from other remote sensing data. The observed significant interannual variability of Greenland ice mass change suggests that it is very challenging to quantify Greenland's long-term ice mass change rates, and some observed apparent accelerations might simply be a reflection of the interannual variability.},

Causal factors identified in this complicated response include sloping surfaces, undulating ice surfaces with characteristic wavelengths on the same spatial scale as the altimeter beam-limited footprint, off-track reflections, and dynamic lag of the altimeter tracking circuit. Retracking methods using the altimeter return pulse waveforms give range corrections that are typically several meters. The entire set of SEASAT-I altimetry over the continental ice sheets is being retracked by fitting a multi-parameter function to each waveform.

  abstract = {Satellite remote sensing observations of three break-up events in 2008 for the Wilkins Ice Shelf (28 February to 6 March, 27 May to 31 May, and 28 June to mid-July) provide unprecedented detail of ice shelf calving during rapid break-up. The observations reveal that the Wilkins break-ups occur through a distinctive type of shelf calving, which we term 'disintegration', as well as more typical rifting and calving. Here we focus on the disintegration process, which is characterized by repeated rapid fracturing that creates narrow ice-edge-parallel blocks, with subsequent block toppling and fragmentation forming an expanding iceberg and ice rubble mass. We use these data to develop and test a model of floating ice plate disintegration in which ice plate bending stresses at the ice front arising from buoyancy forces can lead to runaway calving when free (mobile) water is available. High-resolution satellite images and laser altimetry of the first break-up event provide details of fracture spacings, ice thicknesses, and plate bending profiles that agree well with our model predictions. We suggest that surface or near-surface meltwater is the main pre-condition for disintegration, and that hydro-fracture is the main mechanism. Brine layers from near-waterline brine infiltration can support a similar process, but this is less effective unless regional ice stress patterns contribute to the net stress available at the crack tip for fracturing. A combination of brine-enhanced fracturing and changing internal net extensional stresses was the likely mechanism behind the latter two Wilkins events. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The NASA and ESA retracking algorithms are compared with an algorithm based upon a combined surface and volume (S/V) scattering model. First, the S/V, NASA, and ESA algorithms were used to retrack over 1.3 million altimeter return waveforms from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The surface elevations from the S/V algorithm were compared with the elevations produced by the NASA and ESA algorithms to determine the relative accuracy of these algorithms when subsurface volume scattering occurs. The results show that the ESA25\% algorithm produced slightly higher surface elevations than the S/V algorithm. The NASA retracking algorithm produced lower surface elevations than the SN retracking algorithm, with average differences ranging from -0.3 to -0.9 m. The lower NASA elevations can only account for a portion of previously reported differences between altimeter and geoceiver surface elevations, suggesting that the remainder is probably due to orbital differences. Next, by analyzing several thousand satellite crossover points from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, the author estimated the repeatability of the surface elevations derived from the different retracking algorithms. The elevations derived from the ESA25\% and S/V algorithm had the smallest standard deviations for the crossover differences for a time period where no significant change in surface elevation should occur. The NASA standard deviations were approximately 0.2 m larger than those from the ESA25\% and S/V algorithm, which represents an average increase in error of approximately 0.5 m in the datasets. Since previous ice-sheet growth estimates have been based upon the elevations produced by the NASA retracking algorithm, further work needs to be conducted to determine if the ESA25\% or S/V retracking algorithms produce growth estimates that are significantly different from the previous estimates},

The equilibrium response of the model was compared with ice-core density profiles from Byrd, Antarctica and Site 2, Greenland, and the model predicted the density to within 10\% of both cores.. The response of the model to step-wise changes and random fluctuations in the surface boundary conditions was investigated. The standard deviation of elevation changes as a function of observation interval was computed. These changes were found to be small in comparison with the magnitude of present uncertainties in the mass balances of the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets. It was concluded that, in the dry snow zones, natural variability in the densification will not prevent the geodetic determination of ice sheet mass balance from improving upon current estimates. Uncertainty in the constitutive equation for snow and firn is the dominant source of error in the calculations.},

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of marine ice sheets is integral to studying the evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet in both the short and long terms. An important component of the dynamics, grounding line migration, has proved difficult to represent in numerical models, and most successful attempts have made use of techniques that are only readily applicable to flow line models. However, to capture the stress transmission involved in another important component, the buttressing of a marine ice sheet by its ice shelf, the transverse direction must also be resolved. We introduce a model that solves the time-dependent shelfy stream equations and makes use of mesh adaption techniques to overcome the difficulties typically associated with the numerics of grounding line migration. We compare the model output with a recent benchmark for flow line models and show that our model yields an accurate solution while using far less resources than would be required without mesh adaption. We also show that the mesh adapting techniques extend to two horizontal dimensions. Experiments are carried out to determine how both ice shelf buttressing and ice rises affect the marine instability predicted for an ice sheet on a foredeepened bed. We find that buttressing is not always sufficient to stabilize such a sheet but collapse of the grounded portion is still greatly delayed. We also find that the effect of an ice rise is similar to that of narrowing the ice shelf.},

This long and regular time series is processed using an along-track algorithm to depict in detail the spatial and temporal pattern of elevation change for the whole ice sheet. We use this dataset to examine the spatial and temporal pattern of Pine Island Glacier (PIG) thinning and compare it to the neighbouring glaciers. We also examine additional areas, especially in East Antarctica whose mass balance is poorly known. One advantage of the finer along-track spacing of measurements is that it reveals places of dynamic thinning in regions of rapid ice flow. We observe the acceleration of thinning on PIG. Over the entire basin, the volume loss increased from 7 km3 a{\textendash}1 during 2002{\textendash}06 to \ensuremath{\sim}48 km3 a{\textendash}1 during 2006{\textendash}10. We also observe accelerated thinning on the lower tens of kilometres of Thwaites Glacier, with a mean thinning of 0.18 m a{\textendash}1 over its entire basin during our observation period. We confirm the dynamic thinning of Totten Glacier but we do not detect significantly accelerated thinning on any glacier elsewhere than on the coast of the Amundsen Sea.},

  abstract = {A structural glaciological description and analysis of surface morphological features of the Larsen C ice shelf, Antarctic Peninsula, is derived from satellite images spanning the period 1963-2007. The data are evaluated in two time ranges: a comparison of a 1963 satellite image photomosaic with a modern digital mosaic compiled using 2003/04 austral summer data; and an image series since 2003 showing recent evolution of the shelf. We map the ice-shelf edge, rift swarms, crevasses and crevasse traces, and linear longitudinal structures (called 'flow stripes' or 'streak lines'). The latter are observed to be continuous over distances of up to 200km from the grounding line to the ice-shelf edge, with little evidence of changes in pattern over that distance. Integrated velocity measurements along a flowline indicate that the shelf has been stable for similar to 560years in the mid-shelf area. Linear longitudinal features may be grouped into 12 units, each related to one or a small group of outlet feeder glaciers to the shelf. We observe that the boundaries between these flow units often mark rift terminations. The boundary zones originate upstream at capes, islands or other suture areas between outlet glaciers. In agreement with previous work, our findings imply that rift terminations within such suture zones indicate that they contain anomalously soft ice. We thus suggest that suture zones within the Larsen C ice shelf, and perhaps within ice shelves more generally, may act to stabilize them by reducing regional stress intensities and thus rates of rift lengthening.},

  abstract = {Ranges obtained by radar altimetry from a satellite to a sloping surface on the earth are not measurements of the surface elevation at the subsatellite point. Instead, the reflecting point is displaced upslope from the subsatellite point causing a 'slope-induced error' between the true range to the subsatellite point and the indicated range. For the SEASAT 1 altimeter, this range error is nearly 80 m for a 0.8 degree slope. Ice sheet surface slopes are frequently large enough to cause errors of 10 m or more. In addition, undulations in the surface about a mean slope cause pronounced variations in these errors. Altimeter measurements of ranges to modeled irregular surfaces are simulated and two correction schemes are used to reconstruct the modeled surfaces from the simulated data. The results illustrate the fundamental limitations inherent in single-beam radar altimetry for mapping irregular surfaces. In the simpler two-dimensional case, for which cross-track slopes are neglected, a relocation scheme, which constructs a surface consistent with the altimeter ranges, removes 85\% of the rms error. The mean error along profiles of about 75 km or longer is usually reduced more than the rms error. An alternate slope correction scheme, which uses the local slope to calculate the expected error, is less effective in the two-dimensional case. However, over a simulated three-dimensional surface, where groundtracks are widely spaced and cross-track slopes are significant, the slope-correction method must be used in at least the cross-track direction. The effectiveness of the three-dimensional correction depends on the relative size of the errors caused by the local slope on surface undulations in comparison to the regional slope.},

  abstract = {We consider the reliability of radar altimeter measurements of ice sheet elevation and snowpack properties in the presence of surface undulations. We demonstrate that over ice sheets the common practice of averaging echoes by aligning the first return from the surface at the origin can result in a redistribution of power to later times in the average echo, mimicking the effects of microwave penetration into the snowpack. Algorithms that assume the topography affects the radar echo shape in the same way that waves affect altimeter echoes over the ocean will therefore lead to biased estimates of elevation. This assumption will also cause errors in the retrieval of echo-shape parameters intended to quantify the penetration of the microwave pulse into the snowpack. Using numerical simulations, we estimate the errors in retrievals of extinction coefficient, surface backscatter, and volume backscatter for various undulating topographies. In the flatter portions of the Antarctic plateau, useful estimates of these parameters may be recovered by averaging altimeter echoes recorded by the European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS-1). By numerical deconvolution of the average echoes we resolve the depths in the snowpack at which temporal changes and satellite travel-direction effects occur, both of which have the potential to corrupt measurements of ice sheet elevation change. The temporal changes are isolated in the surface-backscatter cross section, while directional effects are confined to the extinction coefficient and are stable from year to year. This allows the removal of the directional effect from measurement of ice-sheet elevation change.},

New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals.

  abstract = {We present Bedmap2, a new suite of gridded products describing surface elevation, ice-thickness and the seafloor and subglacial bed elevation of the Antarctic south of 60{\textdegree} S. We derived these products using data from a variety of sources, including many substantial surveys completed since the original Bedmap compilation (Bedmap1) in 2001. In particular, the Bedmap2 ice thickness grid is made from 25 million measurements, over two orders of magnitude more than were used in Bedmap1. In most parts of Antarctica the subglacial landscape is visible in much greater detail than was previously available and the improved data-coverage has in many areas revealed the full scale of mountain ranges, valleys, basins and troughs, only fragments of which were previously indicated in local surveys. The derived statistics for Bedmap2 show that the volume of ice contained in the Antarctic ice sheet (27 million km3) and its potential contribution to sea-level rise (58 m) are similar to those of Bedmap1, but the mean thickness of the ice sheet is 4.6\% greater, the mean depth of the bed beneath the grounded ice sheet is 72 m lower and the area of ice sheet grounded on bed below sea level is increased by 10\%. The Bedmap2 compilation highlights several areas beneath the ice sheet where the bed elevation is substantially lower than the deepest bed indicated by Bedmap1. These products, along with grids of data coverage and uncertainty, provide new opportunities for detailed modelling of the past and future evolution of the Antarctic ice sheets.},

  abstract = {We use laser altimetry from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) to map the grounding zone (GZ) of the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica, at 491 locations where ICESat tracks cross the grounding line (GL). Ice flexure in the GZ occurs as the ice shelf responds to short-term sea-level changes due primarily to tides. ICESat repeat-track analysis can be used to detect this region of flexure since each repeated pass is acquired at a different tidal phase; the technique provides estimates for both the landward limit of flexure and the point where the ice becomes hydrostatically balanced. We find that the ICESat-derived landward limits of tidal flexure are, in many places, offset by several km (and up to \ensuremath{\sim}60 km) from the GL mapped previously using other satellite methods. We discuss the reasons why different mapping methods lead to different GL estimates, including: instrument limitations; variability in the surface topographic structure of the GZ; and the presence of ice plains. We conclude that reliable and accurate mapping of the GL is most likely to be achieved when based on synthesis of several satellite datasets.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.asr.2005.07.027},
  abstract = {This paper describes the CryoSat satellite mission, due for launch in 2005, whose aim is to accurately determine the trends in Earth's continental and marine ice fields. The paper's purpose is to provide scientific users of the CryoSat data with a description of the design and operation of the SIRAL radar and the CryoSat platform, the data products, and the expected error budget. The 'low-resolution mode' (LRM), 'synthetic aperture mode' (SARM) and "synthetic aperture interferometric mode' (SARInM) of the SIRAL radar are described, together with its system parameters, its antenna gain pattern and interferometer phase difference pattern, and its calibration modes. The orbit is described, together with the platform attitude and altitude control law and control systems, and the expected pointing and altitude knowledge. The geographical masks that are used to determine acquisitions in the three SIRAL modes are described. The SIRAL data products, and the processing applied to produce them, are described. Level 1b, level 2 and higher-level products are described in turn, with a particular emphasis on the new procedures applied to the SARInM and SARM processing over ice surfaces. The beam forming and multi-looking is summarised, and a description is given of the behaviour of the SARM and SARInM echoes over idealised surfaces. These inform descriptions of the elevation retrievals of the level 2 processing, including the SARInM retrieval of interferometric phase. The combination of these data, through cross-over analysis over continental ice sheets, and through averaging over sea-ice, to determine areal averages of ice sheet elevation change or sea-ice thickness, is described. The error budget in these higher-level products is described, together with its breakdown into errors arising from the instrument and errors arising from the retrievals. The importance of the co-variance of these errors in determining the final error is stressed. The description of the errors also includes a summary of the experiments required following the launch to validate the CryoSat mission data. An estimate of the mission performance over ice surfaces is made at various spatial scales, and it is concluded that even the relatively short, three-year duration of the CryoSat mission will allow it to make an important scientific contribution, particularly when combined with results from earlier satellite missions. ?? 2005 COSPAR.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the echo from a beamforming interferometric altimeter from a uniformly scattering surface inclined at an angle to a sphere, underlain by a uniformly scattering volume. The rough "surface" impulse response and the echo and interferometric cross product are determined as functions of the beam direction and the vector surface gradient. These expressions are used to determine the multilooked echo and interferometric phase from such a system. The "effective" number of looks and the multilooked echo coherence, which determine the statistics of the echo power and the interferometric phase, are defined. The dependence of the multilooked echo power and interferometric phase are investigated as functions of the surface vector gradient, surface roughness, volume scattering, and SNR. These behaviors are illustrated using values based on a practical system. The precision of the elevation measurement is examined in the light of the effective number of looks and the coherence of the multilooked echo and cross product. Some conclusions concerning the practical recovery of the range from the echo power are discussed.},
