  abstract = {Over the past 40 years Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica has thinned at an accelerating rate, so that at present it is the largest single contributor to sea-level rise in Antarctica. In recent years, the grounding line, which separates the grounded ice sheet from the floating ice shelf, has retreated by tens of kilometres. At present, the grounding line is crossing a retrograde bedrock slope that lies well below sea level, raising the possibility that the glacier is susceptible to the marine ice-sheet instability mechanism. Here, using three state-of-the-art ice-flow models, we show that Pine Island Glacier's grounding line is probably engaged in an unstable 40 km retreat. The associated mass loss increases substantially over the course of our simulations from the average value of 20 Gt yr-1 observed for the 1992{\textendash}2011 period, up to and above 100 Gt yr-1, equivalent to 3.5{\textendash}10 mm eustatic sea-level rise over the following 20 years. Mass loss remains elevated from then on, ranging from 60 to 120 Gt yr-1.},

  abstract = {Changes in atmospheric circulation over the past five decades have enhanced the wind-driven inflow of warm ocean water onto the Antarctic continental shelf, where it melts ice shelves from below. Atmospheric circulation changes have also caused rapid warming over the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and contributed to declining sea-ice cover in the adjacent Amundsen{\textendash}Bellingshausen seas. It is unknown whether these changes are part of a longer-term trend. Here, we use water-isotope (\ensuremath{\delta}18O) data from an array of ice-core records to place recent West Antarctic climate changes in the context of the past two millennia. We find that the \ensuremath{\delta}18O of West Antarctic precipitation has increased significantly in the past 50 years, in parallel with the trend in temperature, and was probably more elevated during the 1990s than at any other time during the past 200 years. However, \ensuremath{\delta}18O anomalies comparable to those of recent decades occur about 1\% of the time over the past 2,000 years. General circulation model simulations suggest that recent trends in \ensuremath{\delta}18O and climate in West Antarctica cannot be distinguished from decadal variability that originates in the tropics. We conclude that the uncertain trajectory of tropical climate variability represents a significant source of uncertainty in projections of West Antarctic climate and ice-sheet change.},

The SMB map confirms high accumulation zones in the western Antarctic Peninsula (\ensuremath{>}1500 mm y-1) and coastal West Antarctica (\ensuremath{>}1000 mm y-1), and shows low SMB values in large parts of the interior ice sheet (\ensuremath{<}25 mm y-1). The location and extent of ablation areas are modeled realistically. The modeled SMB is in good agreement with \ensuremath{\pm}750 in-situ SMB measurements (R = 0.88), without a need for post-calibration. The average ice sheet-integrated SMB (including ice shelves) is estimated at 2418 \ensuremath{\pm} 181 Gt y-1. Snowfall shows modest interannual variability (\ensuremath{\sigma} = 114 Gt y-1), but a pronounced seasonal cycle (\ensuremath{\sigma} = 30 Gt mo-1), with a winter maximum. The main ablation process is drifting snow sublimation, which also peaks in winter but with little interannual variability (\ensuremath{\sigma} = 9 Gt y-1).},

  abstract = {We use a combination of satellite techniques (interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), visible-band imagery, and repeat-track laser altimetry) to develop a benchmark map for the Amery Ice Shelf (AIS) grounding zone (GZ), including its islands and ice rises. The break-in-slope, as an indirect estimate of grounding line location, was mapped for the entire AIS. We have also mapped 55\% of the landward edge and 30\% of the seaward edge of the ice shelf flexure boundary for the AIS perimeter. Vertical ice motion from Global Positioning System receivers confirms the location of the satellite-derived GZ in two regions. Our map redefines the extent of floating ice in the south-western AIS and identifies several previously unmapped grounded regions, improving our understanding of the stresses supporting the current dynamical state of the ice shelf. Finally, we identify three along-flow channels in the ice shelf basal topography, approximately 10 km apart, 1.5 km wide and 300{\textendash}500 m deep, near the southern GZ. These channels, which form at the suture zones between ice streams, may represent zones of potential weakness in the ice shelf and may influence sub-ice-shelf ocean circulation.},

This event demonstrated the rapid establishment of extreme Antarctic sea ice conditions on synoptic time scales. The event was associated with cyclones that developed at lower latitudes. Near the event site, cyclone-enhanced strong southeasterly katabatic winds drove large westward drifts of ice floes. In addition, the cyclones also gave southward ice drift. The arrival and grounding of Iceberg B9B in Commonwealth Bay in March 2011 led to the growth of fast ice around it, forming a northward protruding barrier. This barrier blocked the westward ice drift and hence aided sea ice consolidation on its eastern side. Similar cyclone-induced events have occurred at this site in the past after the grounding of Iceberg B9B. Future events may be predictable on synoptic time scales, if cyclone-induced strong wind events can be predicted.},

The warmest waters to reach this region are channeled through a submarine trough, accessed via bathymetric irregularities along the shelf break. Temporal variability in the influx of CDW is related to regional wind forcing. Easterly winds over the shelf edge change to westerlies when the Amundsen Sea Low migrates west and south in winter/spring. This drives seasonal on-shelf flow, while inter-annual changes in the wind forcing lead to inflow variability on a decadal timescale. A modelled period of warming following low CDW influx in the late 1980's and early 1990's coincides with a period of observed thinning and acceleration of Pine Island Glacier.},

The mass changes derived in this study are determined from elevation changes derived measured by the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) for the time period 2003{\textendash}2009. Four methods, based on interpolation and extrapolation, are used to regionalize these elevation changes to areas without satellite coverage. A constant density assumption is then applied to estimate the mass change by integrating over the entire glaciated region.
 The main purpose of this study is to investigate the sensitivity of the regional mass balance of Arctic ice caps and glaciers to different regionalization schemes. The sensitivity analysis is based on studying the spread of mass changes and their associated errors, and the suitability of the different regionalization techniques is assessed through cross-validation.
 The cross-validation results shows comparable accuracies for all regionalization methods, but the inferred mass change in individual regions, such as Svalbard and Iceland, can vary up to 4 Gt a-1, which exceeds the estimated errors by roughly 50\% for these regions. This study further finds that this spread in mass balance is connected to the magnitude of the elevation change variability. This indicates that care should be taken when choosing a regionalization method, especially for areas which exhibit large variability in elevation change.},

We demonstrate that over ice sheets the common practice of averaging echoes by aligning the first return from the surface at the origin can result in a redistribution of power to later times in the average echo, mimicking the effects of microwave penetration into the snowpack. Algorithms that assume the topography affects the radar echo shape in the same way that waves affect altimeter echoes over the ocean will therefore lead to biased estimates of elevation. This assumption will also cause errors in the retrieval of echoshape parameters intended to quantify the penetration of the microwave pulse into the snowpack. Using numerical simulations, we estimate the errors in retrievals of extinction coefficient, surface backscatter, and volume backscatter for various undulating topographies. In the flatter portions of the Antarctic plateau, useful estimates of these parameters may be recovered by averaging altimeter echoes recorded by the European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS-1). By numerical deconvolution of the average echoes we resolve the depths in the snowpack at which temporal changes and satellite travel-direction effects occur, both of which have the potential to corrupt measurements of ice sheet elevation change. The temporal changes are isolated in the surface-backscatter cross section, while directional effects are confined to the extinction coefficient and are stable from year to year. This allows the removal of the directional effect from measurement of ice-sheet elevation change.},

The total balance includes both the surface mass balance processes and the ice-flow components. Mass is added to the surface from snowfall, condensation, and occasional rainfall. Mass is removed by evaporation, surface and bottom melting, water runoff, and iceberg discharge. The chapter discusses the radar altimeter measurement of ice-sheet surface elevations. Several methods have been used to create the digital elevation models (DEMs) of ice sheet topography from satellite altimetry. All methods involve mapping the data onto evenly spaced grids and correcting for the slope error, either before or after the mapping. Full DEMs of Greenland and Antarctica have been produced using triangularization or gridding procedures. A three-step inversion technique has also been demonstrated in small regions by Remy et al: first a large-scale reference surface is estimated, the residuals are mapped related to the undulations, and finally iteratively corrected for the slope error.},

Rapid losses of Arctic sea ice and small Antarctic ice shelves are partially offset by thickening of Antarctic sea ice and large Antarctic ice shelves. Altogether, 746 +/- 127 km(3) yr(-1) of floating ice was lost between 1994 and 2004, a value that exceeds considerably the reduction in grounded ice over the same period. Although the losses are equivalent to a small (49 +/- 8 mm yr(-1)) rise in mean sea level, there may be large regional variations in the degree of ocean freshening and mixing.

Pine Island Glacier in Antarctica has thinned significantly during the last two decades and has provided a measurable contribution to sea-level rise as a result. Both glacier dynamics and climate are thought to be responsible for thinning, but exactly how they influence the glacier are incompletely known. Dutrieux et al. (p. 174, published online 2 January) provide another layer of detail to our understanding of the process through observations of ocean temperatures in the surrounding waters. The thermocline adjacent in the sea adjacent to the glacier calving front (where ice is discharged) lowered by 250 meters in the austral summer of 2012. This change exposed the bottom of the ice shelf to colder surface waters rather than to the warmer, deeper layer, thereby reducing heat transfer from the ocean to the overlying ice and decreasing basal melting of the ice by more than 50\% compared to 2010. Those 2012 ocean conditions were partly caused by a strong La Ni{\~n}a event, thus illustrating how important atmospheric variability is for regulating how the Antarctic Ice Sheet responds to climate change.
Pine Island Glacier has thinned and accelerated over recent decades, significantly contributing to global sea-level rise. Increased oceanic melting of its ice shelf is thought to have triggered those changes. Observations and numerical modeling reveal large fluctuations in the ocean heat available in the adjacent bay and enhanced sensitivity of ice-shelf melting to water temperatures at intermediate depth, as a seabed ridge blocks the deepest and warmest waters from reaching the thickest ice. Oceanic melting decreased by 50\% between January 2010 and 2012, with ocean conditions in 2012 partly attributable to atmospheric forcing associated with a strong La Ni{\~n}a event. Both atmospheric variability and local ice shelf and seabed geometry play fundamental roles in determining the response of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to climate.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the impact of the error due to the penetration of the altimetric wave within the snowpack. The phenomenon has two different impacts. The first one, due to temporal change in snow characteristics, affects the ice sheet volume trend as derived from altimetric series. The second one, because of both the anisotropy of the ice sheet surface properties and of the linear antenna polarization, introduces a difference in measurements at crossover points. These two phenomena are the cause of what are probably the most critical limitations to the interpretation of long-term altimetric series in term of mass balance and to the comparison between or data fusion of different missions. Moreover, they will lead to the largest error when comparing data from EnviSat with data from CryoSat, because of the different orbits, or with data from AltiKa, because of the different radar frequencies. We show that waveform distortions due to snow characteristics fluctuation are complex. In the central part of the East Antarctica, the height and the leading edge width fluctuations vary together while elsewhere, height fluctuations may occur with no variations in the waveform shape, mostly during winter. As a consequence, these induced errors cannot be corrected with solely the help of the backscatter: waveform shape parameters are also needed. They are however not enough to fully correct these two errors. We propose an empirical correction for these effects. We show that crossover differences may be significantly reduced to up 22 cm. In terms of volume change, the estimation may vary up to 4 cm/yr at cross-overs depending on the correction used and is reduced in average to 2.3 cm/yr with our correction. The difference between the height trends estimated with both corrections is weak in average but may locally reach 5 cm/yr with a clear geographical pattern. ?? 2011 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

One method exploits the mathematical completeness of the set of vertically standing modes that are possible in an ocean with a flat floor. This method, though powerful, is inconvenient for the discussion of vertically propagating waves. A different method that exploits the completeness of latitudinal modes is useful for the discussion of such waves that are excited by forcing at a fixed frequency and zonal wave number. Both these methods of solution apply only to the linear equations. To solve the fully nonlinear equations, it is necessary to resort to General Circulation Models. The chapter also describes the equatorial undercurrent. In a continuously stratified ocean, the waves propagate not only horizontally, but also vertically. Vertical modes are rapidly established so that a succession of wave fronts, the barotropic, first baroclinic, and second baroclinic modes emanate from the coasts. The second baroclinic mode plays the dominant role in the adjustment of the upper ocean. The adjustment below the thermocline is complicated and slow because many more vertical modes are involved.},

  abstract = {Resting atop a deep marine basin, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has long been considered prone to instability. Using a numerical model, we investigated the sensitivity of Thwaites Glacier to ocean melt and whether its unstable retreat is already under way. Our model reproduces observed losses when forced with ocean melt comparable to estimates. Simulated losses are moderate (\ensuremath{<}0.25 mm per year at sea level) over the 21st century but generally increase thereafter. Except possibly for the lowest-melt scenario, the simulations indicate that early-stage collapse has begun. Less certain is the time scale, with the onset of rapid (\ensuremath{>}1 mm per year of sea-level rise) collapse in the different simulations within the range of 200 to 900 years.
Antarctic Collapse
The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is particularly vulnerable to ocean warming-induced collapse. The Thwaites Glacier of West Antarctica is one of the largest WAIS regional contributors to sea level rise, and has been considered to be potentially unstable for many years. Joughin et al. (p. 735) used a combination of a numerical model and observations of its recent geometry and movement to investigate the stability of the Thwaites Glacier. The glacier has already entered the early stages of collapse, and rapid and irreversible collapse is likely in the next 200 to 1000 years.},

This pattern of temperature change has been attributed to the increased strength of the circumpolar westerlies, largely in response to changes in stratospheric ozone. This picture, however, is substantially incomplete owing to the sparseness and short duration of the observations. Here we show that significant warming extends well beyond the Antarctic Peninsula to cover most of West Antarctica, an area of warming much larger than previously reported. West Antarctic warming exceeds 0.1 degrees C per decade over the past 50 years, and is strongest in winter and spring. Although this is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica, the continent-wide average near-surface temperature trend is positive. Simulations using a general circulation model reproduce the essential features of the spatial pattern and the long-term trend, and we suggest that neither can be attributed directly to increases in the strength of the westerlies. Instead, regional changes in atmospheric circulation and associated changes in sea surface temperature and sea ice are required to explain the enhanced warming in West Antarctica.},

Here, we use satellite radar altimetry to measure the elevation change of 72\% of the grounded ice sheet during the period 1992-2003. Depending on the density of the snow giving rise to the observed elevation fluctuations, the ice sheet mass trend falls in the range -5-+85Gtyr-1. We find that data from climate model reanalyses are not able to characterise the contemporary snowfall fluctuation with useful accuracy and our best estimate of the overall mass trend-growth of 27+/-29Gtyr-1-is based on an assessment of the expected snowfall variability. Mass gains from accumulating snow, particularly on the Antarctic Peninsula and within East Antarctica, exceed the ice dynamic mass loss from West Antarctica. The result exacerbates the difficulty of explaining twentieth century sea-level rise.},

Some scope remains for methodological improvements using a single data type. In this study we report our progress in increasing the accuracy and spatial resolution of time-variable gravimetry from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). We determine the geographic pattern of ice mass change in Antarctica between January\hspace{0.25em}2003 and June\hspace{0.25em}2014, accounting for glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA) using the IJ05\_R2 model. Expressing the unknown signal in a sparse Slepian basis constructed by optimization to prevent leakage out of the regions of interest, we use robust signal processing and statistical estimation methods. Applying those to the latest time series of monthly GRACE solutions we map Antarctica's mass loss in space and time as well as can be recovered from satellite gravity alone. Ignoring GIA model uncertainty, over the period 2003{\textendash}2014, West Antarctica has been losing ice mass at a rate of - 121 \ensuremath{\pm} 8 ~ Gt / yr and has experienced large acceleration of ice mass losses along the Amundsen Sea coast of - 18 \ensuremath{\pm} 5 ~ Gt / yr 2 , doubling the mass loss rate in the past six years. The Antarctic Peninsula shows slightly accelerating ice mass loss, with larger accelerated losses in the southern half of the Peninsula. Ice mass gains due to snowfall in Dronning Maud Land have continued to add about half the amount of West Antarctica's loss back onto the continent over the last decade. We estimate the overall mass losses from Antarctica since January 2003 at - 92 \ensuremath{\pm} 10 ~ Gt / yr .},

The strongest sea ice teleconnection at the interannual time scale was found between El Ni{\~n}o{\textendash}Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and a high latitude climate mode named the Antarctic Dipole. The Antarctic Dipole is characterized by an out-of-phase relationship between sea ice and surface temperature anomalies in the South Pacific and South Atlantic, manifesting itself and persisting 3{\textendash}4 seasons after being triggered by the ENSO forcing. This study examines the life cycles of ENSO warm and cold events in the tropics and associated evolution of the ADP in high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. In evaluating the mechanisms that form the ADP, the study suggests a synthesized scheme that links these high latitude processes with ENSO teleconnection in both the Pacific and Atlantic basins. The synthesized scheme suggests that the two main mechanisms responsible for the formation/maintenance of the Antarctic Dipole are the heat flux due to the mean meridional circulation of the regional Ferrel Cell and regional anomalous circulation generated by stationary eddies. The changes in the Hadley Cell, the jet stream in the subtropics, and the Rossby Wave train associated with ENSO link the tropical forcing to these high latitude processes. Moreover, these two mechanisms operate in phase and are comparable in magnitude. The positive feedback between the jet stream and stationary eddies in the atmosphere, the positive feedback within the air-sea-ice system, and the seasonality all reinforce the anomalies, resulting in persistent Antarctic Dipole anomalies.},

  abstract = {Abstract. ICESat has provided surface elevation measurements of the ice sheets since the launch in January 2003, resulting in a unique dataset for monitoring the changes of the cryosphere. Here, we present a novel method for determining the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet, derived from ICESat altimetry data. Three different methods for deriving elevation changes from the ICESat altimetry dataset are used. This multimethod approach provides a method to assess the complexity of deriving elevation changes from this dataset. The altimetry alone can not provide an estimate of the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet. Firn dynamics and surface densities are important factors that contribute
to the mass change derived from remote-sensing altimetry. The volume change derived from ICESat data is corrected for changes in firn compaction over the observation period, vertical bedrock movement and an intercampaign elevation bias in the ICESat data. Subsequently, the corrected volume change is converted into mass change by the application of a simple surface density model, in which some of the ice dynamics are accounted for. The firn compaction and density models are driven by the HIRHAM5 regional climate model, forced by the ERA-Interim re-analysis product, at the lateral boundaries. We find annual mass loss estimates of the Greenland ice sheet in the range of 191\ensuremath{\pm}23 Gt yr-1 to 240\ensuremath{\pm}28 Gt yr-1 for the period October 2003 to March 2008. These results are in good agreement with several other studies of the Greenland ice sheet mass balance, based on different remote-sensing techniques.},

The polar climate anomalies are correlated with the Southern Oscillation index (SOI) and the composites of these anomalies are examined under the positive (SOI \ensuremath{>} 0), neutral (0 \ensuremath{>} SOI \ensuremath{>} -1), and negative (SOI \ensuremath{<} -1) phases of SOI. The climate dataset consists of sea level pressure, wind, surface air temperature, and sea surface temperature fields, while the sea ice dataset describes its extent, concentration, motion, and surface temperature. The analysis depicts, for the first time, the spatial variability in the relationship of the above variables with the SOI. The strongest correlation between the SOI and the polar climate anomalies are found in the Bellingshausen, Amundsen, and Ross Seas. The composite fields reveal anomalies that are organized in distinct large-scale spatial patterns with opposing polarities at the two extremes of SOI, and suggest oscillations that are closely linked to the SO. Within these sectors, positive (negative) phases of the SOI are generally associated with lower (higher) sea level pressure, cooler (warmer) surface air temperature, and cooler (warmer) sea surface temperature in these sectors. Associations between these climate anomalies and the behavior of the Antarctic sea ice cover are evident. Recent anomalies in the sea ice cover that are clearly associated with the SOI include the following: the record decrease in the sea ice extent in the Bellingshausen Sea from mid-1988 to early 1991; the relationship between Ross Sea SST and the ENSO signal, and reduced sea ice concentration in the Ross Sea; and the shortening of the ice season in the eastern Ross Sea, Amundsen Sea, far western Weddell Sea and lengthening of the ice season in the western Ross Sea, Bellinghausen Sea, and central Weddell Sea gyre during the period 1988{\textendash}94. Four ENSO episodes over the last 17 years contributed to a negative mean in the SOI (-0.5). In each of these episodes, significant retreats in ice cover of the Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas were observed showing a unique association of this region of the Antarctic with the Southern Oscillation.},

  abstract = {The problem of measuring surface height and snowpack characteristics from satellite radar altimeter echoes is investigated. In this paper, we perform an analysis of the ERS1 altimeter dataset acquired during a 3 day repeat orbit. The analysis reveals that there are temporal variations in shapes of the radar altimeter echo and that these variations are linked to meteorological phenomena. The time- and space-scales over which these variations apply are a few to tens of days and a few hundred kilometres, respectively. This phenomenon, if not accounted for, can create error in the height measurement. A numerical echo model is used to recover snowpack characteristics by taking advantage of the temporal variations of the radar echoes, A map of penetration depth of the radar waves in the Ku band over the;Antarctic continent is obtained and suggests that grain-size produces the dominant effect on radar extinction in the snowpack at this frequency. Finally, a procedure is proposed to correct the height measurement within the contest of ice-sheet mass-balance survey.},

We compare the mass fluxes from large drainage basin units with interior snow accumulation calculated from a regional atmospheric climate model for 1980 to 2004.

Time-varying rates of mass loss contribute to this, but substantial technique-specific systematic errors also exist. In particular, estimates of secular ice-mass change derived from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data are dominated by significant uncertainty in the accuracy of models of mass change due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). Here we adopt a new model of GIA, developed from geological constraints, which produces GIA rates systematically lower than those of previous models, and an improved fit to independent uplift data. After applying the model to 99 months (from August 2002 to December 2010) of GRACE data, we estimate a continent-wide ice-mass change of -69 \ensuremath{\pm} 18 Gt yr(-1) (+0.19 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.05 mm yr(-1) sea-level equivalent). This is about a third to a half of the most recently published GRACE estimates, which cover a similar time period but are based on older GIA models. Plausible GIA model uncertainties, and errors relating to removing longitudinal GRACE artefacts ('destriping'), confine our estimate to the range -126 Gt yr(-1) to -29 Gt yr(-1) (0.08-0.35 mm yr(-1) sea-level equivalent). We resolve 26 independent drainage basins and find that Antarctic mass loss, and its acceleration, is concentrated in basins along the Amundsen Sea coast. Outside this region, we find that West Antarctica is nearly in balance and that East Antarctica is gaining substantial mass.},

  doi = {10.3189/172756402781817752},
  abstract = {We describe a new tide model for the seas surrounding Antarctica, including the ocean cavities under the floating ice shelves. The model uses data assimilation to improve its fit to available data. Typical peak-to-peak tide ranges on ice shelves are 1-2 m but can exceed 3 m for the Filchner-Ronne and Larsen Ice Shelves in the Weddell Sea. Spring tidal ranges are about twice these values. Model performance is judged relative to the {\textasciitilde}5-10 cm accuracy that is needed to fully utilize ice-shelf height data that will be collected with the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System, scheduled to be launched on the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite in late 2002. The model does not yet achieve this level of accuracy except very near the few high-quality tidal records that have been assimilated into the model. Some improvement in predictive skill is expected from increased sophistication of model physics, but we also require better definition of ice-shelf grounding lines and more accurate water-column thickness data in shelf seas and under the ice shelves. Long-duration tide measurements (bottom pressure gauge or global positioning system) in critical datasparse areas, particularly near and on the Filchner-Ronne and Ross Ice Shelves and Pine Island Bay, are required to improve the performance of the data-assimilation model.},

  doi = {10.1029/2011JC007301},
  abstract = {Several Antarctic Peninsula (AP) ice shelves have lost significant fractions of their volume over the past decades, coincident with rapid regional climate change. Wilkins Ice Shelf (WIS), on the western side of the AP, is the most recent, experiencing a sequence of large calving events in 2008 and 2009. We analyze the mass balance for WIS for the period 1992-2008 and find that the averaged rate of ice-shelf thinning was \ensuremath{\sim}0.8 m a-1, driven by a mean basal melt rate of 〈wb〉 = 1.3 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.4 m a-1. Interannual variability was large, associated with changes in both surface mass accumulation and 〈wb〉. Basal melt rate declined significantly around 2000 from 1.8 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.4 m a-1 for 1992{\textendash}2000 to \ensuremath{\sim}0.75 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.55 m a-1 for 2001{\textendash}2008; the latter value corresponding to approximately steady-state ice-shelf mass. Observations of ocean temperature T obtained during 2007{\textendash}2009 by instrumented seals reveal a cold, deep halo of Winter Water (WW; T \ensuremath{\approx} -1.6{\textdegree}C) surrounding WIS. The base of the WW in the halo is \ensuremath{\sim}170 m, approximately the mean ice draft for WIS. We hypothesize that the transition in 〈wb〉 in 2000 was caused by a small perturbation (\ensuremath{\sim}10{\textendash}20 m) in the relative depths of the ice base and the bottom of the WW layer in the halo. We conclude that basal melting of thin ice shelves like WIS is very sensitive to upper-ocean and coastal processes that act on shorter time and space scales than those affecting basal melting of thicker West Antarctic ice shelves such as George VI and Pine Island Glacier.},

Any strong change in ENSO statistics will therefore have serious climatic and ecological consequences. Most global climate models do simulate ENSO, although large biases exist with respect to its characteristics. The ENSO response to global warming differs strongly from model to model and is thus highly uncertain. Some models simulate an increase in ENSO amplitude, others a decrease, and others virtually no change. Extremely strong changes constituting tipping point behavior are not simulated by any of the models. Nevertheless, some interesting changes in ENSO dynamics can be inferred from observations and model integrations. Although no tipping point behavior is envisaged in the physical climate system, smooth transitions in it may give rise to tipping point behavior in the biological, chemical, and even socioeconomic systems. For example, the simulated weakening of the Pacific zonal sea surface temperature gradient in the Hadley Centre model (with dynamic vegetation included) caused rapid Amazon forest die-back in the mid-twenty-first century, which in turn drove a nonlinear increase in atmospheric CO2, accelerating global warming.},

Three independent methods now exist for assessing ice-sheet mass balance and we focus on progress in two: satellite altimetry (ICESat) and gravimetry (GRACE). With improved spatial and temporal sampling, and synergy with ice flow measurements, both the mechanisms and causes changing
mass balance can be investigated. We present examples of mass losses due to widespread, intensifying glacier dynamic thinning in northwest Greenland, but local ablation rates in the northeast that are unchanged for decades. Advances in GRACE processing reveal Greenland net ice-sheet mass loss
continuing into 2010, at 19530 Gt a{\textendash}1. A similarly negative trend in the Gulf of Alaska has significant spatial and temporal variation, that highlights the importance of intense summer melting here. Strong
summer melt on the Antarctic Peninsula also precipitated recent ice-shelf collapse and prompted rapid dynamic thinning of tributary glaciers at up to 70ma{\textendash}1. Thinning continued for years to decades after collapse and propagated far inland. While understanding of the physical mechanisms of change continues to improve, estimates of future behaviour, and in particular the near-future glacial sea-level contribution, still rely on projections from such observations.We introduce the suite of new sensors that
will monitor the ice sheets into the future.},

  abstract = {In Antarctica, radar altimeter measurements are sensitive to dielectric and penetration properties of the sensed medium (snow) such that the spacecraft's altitude can be biased. Since 2002, relatively low frequency radar measurements over the Amery Ice Shelf, east Antarctica, have been acquired using the Envisat dual frequency altimeter at S (3.2~GHz) and Ku (13.6~GHz) bands, which penetrate a few meters into the firn. The altimeter signal is however modified in summer by the presence of snowfilled crevasses. Indeed, the specularity of the snow surfaces in summer makes the altimetric signal sensitive mostly to nadir echoes, that increases the ratio between the crevasse signal and the surrounding ice-shelf signal at nadir. Crevasses are distinguished by differences in backscattering behavior compared with the surrounding ice-shelf signal. Crevasses are characterized by a strong backscatter coefficient at Ku band and anomalies in the S band altitude estimation. These two characteristics make snowfilled crevasses detectable by the dual frequency altimeter of Envisat. We first retrieve the geometric properties of the crevasses using a hyperbolic shape function, created by strong crevasse backscatter in the Ku waveform measurements. From this retrieved crevasse signal and further waveform analysis, we assess the properties of the snow surface and its sub-surface. The crevasse, due to its small size compared to the altimeter footprint, is found to be an excellent target to study snow properties of the ice-shelf. The anomalies in the S band altitude measurements over crevasses can then be explained by the presence of a double echo in the S band waveforms. This echo is attributed to a reflection at the base of the snowbridge, where we see evidence of sub-surface echos in the individual altimeter waveforms. Based on this observation, a methodology is developed to estimate the thickness of the snowbridge. We calculate the penetration depths in the summer snow surface of the Amery at Ku band, that is found to be around 6~m. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Simplified expressions are obtained for both the impulse response and the average backscattered power for near normal incidence under the assumptions common to satellite radar altimetry systems. In particular, it is shown that the conventional two-dimensional surface integration can be reduced to a closed form solution. Two applications of these results are presented relative to radar altimetry, namely, radar antenna pointing angle determination and altitude bias correction for pointing angle and surface roughness effects. It is also shown that these results have direct application to the analysis of the two frequency system proposed by Weissman, and a possible combined long pulse altimeter and two frequency system is suggested.},

Jorum and Crane glaciers accelerated twofold in early 2003 and threefold by the end of 2003. In contrast, Flask and Leppard glaciers, further south, did not accelerate as they are still buttressed by an ice shelf. The mass loss associated with the flow acceleration exceeds 27 km3 per year, and ice is thinning at rates of tens of meters per year. We attribute this abrupt evolution of the glaciers to the removal of the buttressing ice shelf.

  abstract = {By comparing modelled and averaged
satellite altimeter return, it is demonstrated that time
profiles of altimeter return can be used to provide
important information on the surface properties of the ice
sheets. Altimeter ice-sheet radar echoes from low altitudes
and/ or relatively low latitudes are, in general, dominated by
surface scattering and, in Greenland, the area of
surface-dominated return broadly coincides with the zone of
summer melting. Seasonal variations in the echo wave-form
shapes are negligible in all regions studied, with the possible
exception of an area near the margin of the Greenland
dry-snow zone. In general, the model explains well the
observed variations in mean wave-form shape, but small
discrepances between the model wave forms and the
recorded wave forms indicate that sub-surface layers may
be influencing the shape of the return. The possibility of
deriving quantitative estimates of surface properties is
explored by fitting model returns to averaged altimeter wave
forms from the Wilkes Land plateau in Antarctica. Surface
roughness can be measured unambiguously from the
wave-form data, but estimations of other parameters, such
as grain-size, snow density, and snow temperature are found
to be ambiguous because different surface parameters have a
similar influence on the shape of the return. Despite this,
the derived estimates compare well with ground-based
observations and suggest that the satellite altimeter may have
an important role to play in providing information on the
surface properties of the ice sheets.},

To date, measurements of the area of ice shelves on the AP have either been approximated, or calculated for individual shelves over dissimilar time intervals. Here we present a new dataset containing up-to-date and consistent area calculations for each of the twelve ice shelves on the AP over the past five decades. The results reveal an overall reduction in total ice-shelf area by over 28 000 km(2) since the beginning of the period. Individual ice shelves show different rates of retreat, ranging from slow but progressive retreat to abrupt collapse. We discuss the pertinent features of each ice shelf and also broad spatial and temporal patterns in the timing and rate of retreat. We believe that an understanding of this diversity and what it implies about the underlying dynamics and control will provide the best foundation for developing a reliable predictive skill for ice-shelf change.},

robust statistics. The technical term {\textquotedblleft}robust{\textquotedblright} was coined only in 1953 (by
G. E. P. Box), and the subject matter acquired recognition as a legitimate
topic for investigation only in the mid-sixties, but it certainly never was a
revolutionary new concept. Among the leading scientists of the late nineteenth
and early twentieth century, there were several practicing statisticians
(to name but a few: the astronomer S. Newcomb, the astrophysicist
A. Eddington, and the geophysicist H. Jeffreys), who had a perfectly clear,
operational understanding of the idea; they knew the dangers of long-tailed
error distributions, they proposed probability models for gross errors, and
they even invented excellent robust alternatives to the standard estimates,
which were rediscovered only recently. But for a long time theoretical
statisticians tended to shun the subject as being inexact and {\textquotedblleft}dirty.{\textquotedblright} My
1964 paper may have helped to dispel such prejudices. Amusingly (and
disturbingly), it seems that lately a kind of bandwagon effect has evolved,
that the pendulum has swung to the other extreme, and that {\textquotedblleft}robust{\textquotedblright} has
now become a magic word, which is invoked in order to add respectability.
This book gives a solid foundation in robustness to both the theoretical
and the applied statistician. The treatment is theoretical, but the stress is
on concepts, rather than on mathematical completeness. The level of
presentation is deliberately uneven: in some chapters simple cases are
treated with mathematical rigor; in others the results obtained in the
simple cases are transferred by analogy to more complicated situations
(like multiparameter regression and covariance matrix estimation), where
proofs are not always available (or are available only under unrealistically
severe assumptions). Also selected numerical algorithms for computing
robust estimates are described and, where possible, convergence proofs are
given.},

  abstract = {In this paper, several techniques to improve the processing and analysis of decadal elevation-change time series (ECTS) constructed using satellite radar altimeter data over the Antarctic ice sheet are described. First, a method that improves both the quality and quantity of ice-sheet ECTS is introduced. By dynamically selecting the reference month used in constructing ECTS for a given local region, the maximum number of elevation-change estimates are used in a matrix processing technique. This can improve ECTS quality while also generating ECTS in new areas, leading to a significant increase in spatial coverage. Next, an improved autoregressive (IAR) approach is presented for modeling nonlinear medium-period variations in decadal Antarctic ECTS. This builds upon previous work where an AR model was used to characterize seasonal and interannual variations in ice-sheet ECTS. The improved approach avoids overdecomposition by adopting an iterative local average filter to estimate nonlinear medium-period trends. Monte Carlo simulations show that the IAR method significantly outperforms the AR method when realistic nonlinear trends are present. Because of these characteristics, the IAR model is able to adequately characterize seasonal, interannual, and medium-period nonlinear signals present in decadal ECTS and extract their long-term trends with very small error. This is important for accurate measurement of decadal elevation change over the Antarctic ice sheet and for assessing the impact of these changes on the global sea level},

  abstract = {We compare rates of surface-elevation change on the Greenland ice sheet derived from European Remote-sensing Satellite-2 (ERS-2) radar-altimeter data with those obtained from laser-altimeter data collected over nearly the same time periods. Radar-altimeter data show more rapid thickening (9\ensuremath{\pm}1 cm a-1 above 1500 m elevation in the north, and 3\ensuremath{\pm}1 cm a-1 above 2000 m in the south) than the laser estimates, possibly caused by a lifting of the radar-reflection horizon associated with changes in the snowpack, such as those caused by progressively increased surface melting, as summer temperatures rise. Over all the ice sheet above 2000 m, this results in an ERS-derived volume balance \ensuremath{\sim}75\ensuremath{\pm}15 km3 a-1 more positive than that from laser data. This bias between laser and radar estimates of elevation change varies spatially and temporally, so cannot at present be corrected without independent surveys such as those presented here. At lower elevations, comparison of detailed repeat laser surveys over Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae} with ERS results over the same time interval shows substantial ERS underestimation of ice-thinning rates. This results partly from missing data because of 'bad' radar waveforms over the very rough surface topography, and partly from the tendency for large radar footprints to sample preferentially local high points in the topography, thus missing regions of most rapid thinning along glacier depressions.},

  abstract = {Satellite-borne radar altimetry offers a unique opportunity for measuring the form and mass balance of the polar ice sheets. Changes in ice-sheet mass balance are intimately linked to climatic change and variations in the global mean sea level. However, previous altimeter measurements of ice-sheet topography have been made without the use of a well-validated model of the altimeter return. Here, we present a theoretical model of the return which, supported by both observational and experimental evidence, suggests that over vast areas of the higher altitude regions of the ice-sheets, significant radar penetration of the firn occurs at frequencies commonly used for space altimetry. This implies the need for a previously-neglected correction to height measurements which can be as much as 3-3 m, depending on the retracking method and location. Since the degree of radar penetration may exhibit variability over a range of time-scales, failure to account for the effect could lead to erroneous estimates of surface elevation change. The detection of variability in the degree of penetration is of considerable interest from the point of view of monitoring the processes of accumulation and ablation of snow over the ice-sheet surface, as the return is particularly sensitive to conditions within a few centimetres of the surface. The model has wider applications as it may be used in modified form to simulate altimeter return from all smooth surfaces which exhibit a combination of surface and volume scattering, including deserts and the surfaces of the terrestrial planets and their satellites.},

  abstract = {The extent and duration of surface melting on the Antarctic ice shelves and margins of the Antarctic ice sheet are derived from satellite passive-microwave data for 1978-87. The occurrence of surface melting in daily maps of T-b is indicated by a marked increase in microwave brightness temperature (T-b), which is caused by moisture in the near-surface firn. T-b increases of more than 30 deg above the annual-mean T-b are chosen to indicate melting. Most Antarctic surface melting occurs during December and January. The observed melting is correlated with regional air temperatures, but some melt patterns also appear to be related to katabatic-wind effects. The correlations suggest that the surface melting in Antarctica increases about 3.5 x 10(6) d km(2) per degree of summer temperature increase. The surface-melt index (duration times area of melting) calculated for Antarctica is 24 x 10(6) d km(2), averaged over nine summers. The observed inter-annual and regional variability is large. Surface melting was most extensive during the 1982/83 summer (36 x 10(6) d km(2)) and least extensive during the 1985/86 summer (15 x 10(6) d km(2)). The data indicate a decline in surface melting over the 9 years, but meaningful inferences regarding trends in surface melting are precluded by the large inter-annual variability.},

Tide models under review include empirical, purely hydrodynamic ({\textquotedblleft}forward{\textquotedblright}), and assimilative dynamical, i.e., constrained by observations. Ten dominant tidal constituents in the diurnal, semidiurnal, and quarter-diurnal bands are considered. Since the last major model comparison project in 1997, models have improved markedly, especially in shallow-water regions and also in the deep ocean. The root-sum-square differences between tide observations and the best models for eight major constituents are approximately 0.9, 5.0, and 6.5 cm for pelagic, shelf, and coastal conditions, respectively. Large intermodel discrepancies occur in high latitudes, but testing in those regions is impeded by the paucity of high-quality in situ tide records. Long-wavelength components of models tested by analyzing satellite laser ranging measurements suggest that several models are comparably accurate for use in precise orbit determination, but analyses of GRACE intersatellite ranging data show that all models are still imperfect on basin and subbasin scales, especially near Antarctica. For the M2 constituent, errors in purely hydrodynamic models are now almost comparable to the 1980-era Schwiderski empirical solution, indicating marked advancement in dynamical modeling. Assessing model accuracy using tidal currents remains problematic owing to uncertainties in in situ current meter estimates and the inability to isolate the barotropic mode. Velocity tests against both acoustic tomography and current meters do confirm that assimilative models perform better than purely hydrodynamic models.},

In areas covered by the Seasat orbit (to 72.16{\textdegree}S), regional-averaged 30-year trends were negative (surface lowering), with rates between -0.03 and -0.16 m a-1. Surface lowering preceded the start of near-continuous radar altimeter operations that began with ERS-1 in 1992. The average rate of lowering for the first 14 years of the period was typically smaller than the 30-year average; the exception was the southern Wilkins Ice Shelf, which experienced negligible lowering between 2000 and 2008, when a series of large calving events began. Analyses of the continuous ERS/Envisat time series (to 81.5{\textdegree}) for 1992{\textendash}2008 reveal a period of strong negative dhi/dt on most ice shelves between 1992 and 1995. Based on prior studies of regional atmospheric and oceanic conditions, we hypothesize that the observed elevation changes on Larsen C Ice Shelf are driven primarily by firn compaction while the western AP ice shelves are responding to changes in both surface mass balance and basal melt rates. Our time series also show that large changes in dhi/dt can occur on interannual time scales, reinforcing the importance of long time series altimetry to separate long-term trends associated with climate change from interannual to interdecadal natural variability.},

  abstract = {We have reprocessed ERS-1 radar altimeter waveforms using an algorithm designed to minimize sea surface slope error and decouple it from significant wave height (SWH) error. Standard waveform retracking estimates three parameters-arrival time, SWH and amplitude. We show that errors in retracked estimates of arrival time and SWH are inherently correlated because of the noise characteristics of the returned waveform. This suggests that some of what is called 'sea state bias' in the literature may be caused by correlated errors rather than true electromagnetic or skewness bias. We have developed a retracking algorithm that reduces this error correlation and makes the resolution of sea surface slope signals independent of sea state. The main assumption is that the SWH varies smoothly along the satellite track over wavelengths of 90 km. This approach reduces the rms error in sea surface slope to only 62 per cent of that of standard retracking methods. While our method is optimized for gravity field recovery, it may also improve the resolution of sea surface height signals of interest to physical oceanographers.},

Many scientific disciples concerned with the Antarctic require an understanding of how the climatic conditions in the tropical and mid-latitude regions affect the Antarctic, and it is hoped that this review will aid their work. The most pronounced signals of ENSO are found over the southeast Pacific as a result of a climatological Rossby wave train that gives positive (negative) height anomalies over the Amundsen{\textendash}Bellingshausen Sea during El Ni{\~n}o (La Ni{\~n}a) events. However, the extra-tropical signature can sometimes show a high degree of variability between events in this area. In West Antarctica, links between ENSO and precipitation have shown variability on the decadal time scale. Across the continent itself, it is even more difficult to relate meteorological conditions to ENSO, yet analyses of the long meteorological records from the stations do indicate a distinct switch in sign of the pressure anomalies from positive to negative across the minimum in the southern oscillation index. The oceanic signals of ENSO around the Antarctic are less clear, but it has been suggested that the Antarctic circumpolar wave could be forced by the phenomenon. Ice-core data offer the potential to help in understanding the long-term relationship between ENSO and the climate of the Antarctic, but there are difficulties because of the need to smooth the ice-core data to overcome the mixing of snow on the surface. Nevertheless, analysis of methylsulphonic acid in a South Pole core has shown high variability on ENSO time scales. It is clear that some evidence of ENSO can be found in the Antarctic meteorological and ice-core records; however, many of the relationships tend not to be stable with time, and we currently have a poor understanding of the transfer functions by which such signals arrive at the Antarctic from the tropical Pacific.

Here a novel method is presented for using radar sounding measurements to decompose the total thickness of floating ice shelves into thicknesses of solid ice and firn air (or firn water). The method is applied to a 1997/98 airborne survey of Larsen Ice Shelf, revealing large spatial gradients in air content that are consistent with existing measurements and local meteorology. The gradients appear to be governed by meltwater-induced firn densification. We find sufficient air in Larsen C Ice Shelf for increased densification to account for its previously observed surface lowering, and the rate of lowering superficially agrees with published trends in melting. This does not preclude a contribution to the lowering from oceanic basal melting, but a modern repeat of the survey could conclusively distinguish atmosphere-led from ocean-led change. The technique also holds promise for the calibration of firn-density models, derivation of ice thickness from surface elevation measurements, and calculation of the sea-level contribution of changes in grounded-ice discharge.},

Basal melt of 1325 \ensuremath{\pm} 235 gigatons per year (Gt/year) exceeds a calving flux of 1089 \ensuremath{\pm} 139 Gt/year, making ice-shelf melting the largest ablation process in Antarctica. The giant cold-cavity Ross, Filchner, and Ronne ice shelves covering two-thirds of the total ice-shelf area account for only 15\% of net melting. Half of the meltwater comes from 10 small, warm-cavity Southeast Pacific ice shelves occupying 8\% of the area. A similar high melt/area ratio is found for six East Antarctic ice shelves, implying undocumented strong ocean thermal forcing on their deep grounding lines.
Major Meltdown
The ice shelves and floating ice tongues that surround Antarctica cover more than 1.5 million square kilometers{\textemdash}approximately the size of the entire Greenland Ice Sheet. Conventional wisdom has held that ice shelves around Antarctica lose mass mostly by iceberg calving, but recently it has become increasingly clear that melting by a warming ocean may also be important. Rignot et al. (p. 266, published 13 June) present detailed glaciological estimates of ice-shelf melting around the entire continent of Antarctica, which show that basal melting accounts for as much mass loss as does calving.},

The surface of Larsen C Ice Shelf (LCIS), the largest ice shelf on the peninsula, is lowering. This could be caused by unbalanced ocean melting (ice loss) or enhanced firn melting and compaction (englacial air loss). Using a novel method to analyse eight radar surveys, this study derives separate estimates of ice and air thickness changes during a 15-year period. The uncertainties are considerable, but the primary estimate is that the surveyed lowering (0.066 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.017 m yr-1) is caused by both ice loss (0.28 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.18 m yr-1) and firn-air loss (0.037 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.026 m yr-1). The ice loss is much larger than the air loss, but both contribute approximately equally to the lowering because the ice is floating. The ice loss could be explained by high basal melting and/or ice divergence, and the air loss by low surface accumulation or high surface melting and/or compaction. The primary estimate therefore requires that at least two forcings caused the surveyed lowering. Mechanisms are discussed by which LCIS stability could be compromised in the future. The most rapid pathways to collapse are offered by the ungrounding of LCIS from Bawden Ice Rise or ice-front retreat past a "compressive arch" in strain rates. Recent evidence suggests that either mechanism could pose an imminent risk.},

The grounded ice boundary is 53 610 km long; 74\% of it abuts to floating ice shelves or outlet glaciers, 19\% is adjacent to open or sea-ice covered ocean, and 7\% of the boundary are land terminations with bare rock. Elevations along each line are selected from 6 candidate digital elevation models: two created from the input ICESat laser altimetry and Landsat data, two from stereo satellite imagery, and two from compilations of primarily radar altimetry. Elevation selection and an assignment of confidence in the elevation value are based on agreement with ICESat elevation values and shape of the surface inferred from the Landsat imagery. Elevations along the freely-floating boundary (called the hydrostatic line) are converted to ice thicknesses by applying a firn-correction factor and a flotation criterion. The relationship between the seaward offset of the hydrostatic line from the grounding line only weakly matches a prediction based on beam theory. Airborne data are used to validate the technique of grounding line mapping, elevation selection and ice thickness derivation.

  abstract = {Introduction
George VI Ice Shelf, sandwiched between the western coast of Palmer Land and the eastern coast of Alexander Island, is the largest and most studied of the west Antarctic
Peninsula ice shelves. It covers an area of approximately 25,000 km2 and is underlain by Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), with temperatures in excess of 1{\textordmasculine}C, giving rise to rapid basal melting (Bishop and Walton, 1981; Lennon et al., 1982). The maximum ice thickness of about 500 m occurs about 70 km from the southern ice front, where a ridge of thick ice extends across George VI Sound (near 70{\textordmasculine}W, see Figure 1) effectively dividing the upper water column into northern and southern regions. The northern ice front, which faces Marguerite Bay, appears to be near the geographical limit of ice shelf viability and has
undergone a gradual retreat in recent decades (Lucchitta and Rosanova, 1998), a timeframe over which much of the nearby Wordie Ice Shelf disintegrated (Doake and Vaughan, 1991). There is extensive surface melting over the northern parts of the ice shelf and much of the ice column near the northern ice front appears to be temperate (Paren and Cooper, 1986). Conditions in the south, where the ice front faces into Ronne Entrance, are colder and the ice
front position appears to be steady. The vast majority of the flow into the ice shelf comes from Palmer Land, but basal melting is sufficient to remove most of this, so that the ice is derived almost exclusively from local accumulation by the time it reaches the ice fronts
(Potter et al., 1984). There is some evidence at the margins of the ice shelf to suggest that it may have disappeared completely during the early Holocene before reforming (Sugden and Clapperton, 1981; Bentley et al., 2005).},

The 300 Gt/year range is approximately 15\% of the annual mass input and 0.8 mm/year Sea Level Equivalent (SLE). Two estimates from radar altimeter measurements of elevation change by European Remote-sensing Satellites (ERS) (+28 and -31 Gt/year) lie in the upper part, whereas estimates from the Input-minus-Output Method (IOM) and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) lie in the lower part (-40 to -246 Gt/year). We compare the various estimates, discuss the methodology used, and critically assess the results. We also modify the IOM estimate using (1) an alternate extrapolation to estimate the discharge from the non-observed 15\% of the periphery, and (2) substitution of input from a field data compilation for input from an atmospheric model in 6\% of area. The modified IOM estimate reduces the loss from 136 Gt/year to 13 Gt/year. Two ERS-based estimates, the modified IOM, and a GRACE-based estimate for observations within 1992-2005 lie in a narrowed range of +27 to -40 Gt/year, which is about 3\% of the annual mass input and only 0.2 mm/year SLE. Our preferred estimate for 1992-2001 is -47 Gt/year for West Antarctica, +16 Gt/year for East Antarctica, and -31 Gt/year overall (+0.1 mm/year SLE), not including part of the Antarctic Peninsula (1.07\% of the AIS area). Although recent reports of large and increasing rates of mass loss with time from GRACE-based studies cite agreement with IOM results, our evaluation does not support that conclusion.},

  abstract = {The floating ice shelves surrounding the Antarctic Ice Sheet restrain the grounded ice-sheet flow. Thinning of an ice shelf reduces this effect, leading to an increase in ice discharge to the ocean. Using 18 years of continuous satellite radar altimeter observations, we have computed decadal-scale changes in ice-shelf thickness around the Antarctic continent. Overall, average ice-shelf volume change accelerated from negligible loss at 25 \ensuremath{\pm} 64 cubic kilometers per year for 1994{\textendash}2003 to rapid loss of 310 \ensuremath{\pm} 74 cubic kilometers per year for 2003{\textendash}2012. West Antarctic losses increased by {\textasciitilde}70\% in the past decade, and earlier volume gain by East Antarctic ice shelves ceased. In the Amundsen and Bellingshausen regions, some ice shelves have lost up to 18\% of their thickness in less than two decades.
Disappearing faster around the edges
The floating ice shelves around Antarctica, which buttress ice streams from the continent and slow their discharge into the sea, are thinning at faster rates. Paolo et al. present satellite data showing that ice shelves in many regions around the edge of the continent are losing mass. This result increases concern about how fast sea level might rise as climate continues to warm. If warming continues to cause ice shelves to thin, as they have for the past couple of decades, their disappearance may allow land-based ice to collapse and melt.

  abstract = {Widespread glacier acceleration has been observed in Greenland in the past few years(1-4) associated with the thinning of the lower reaches of the glaciers as they terminate in the ocean(5-7). These glaciers thin both at the surface, from warm air temperatures, and along their submerged faces in contact with warm ocean waters(8). Little is known about the rates of submarine melting(9-11) and how they may affect glacier dynamics. Here we present measurements of ocean currents, temperature and salinity near the calving fronts of the Eqip Sermia, Kangilerngata Sermia, Sermeq Kujatdleq and Sermeq Avangnardleq glaciers in central West Greenland, as well as ice-front bathymetry and geographical positions. We calculate water-mass and heat budgets that reveal summer submarine melt rates ranging from 0.7 +/- 0.2 to 3.9 +/- 0.8 m d(-1). These rates of submarine melting are two orders of magnitude larger than surface melt rates, but comparable to rates of iceberg discharge. We conclude that ocean waters melt a considerable, but highly variable, fraction of the calving fronts of glaciers before they disintegrate into icebergs, and suggest that submarine melting must have a profound influence on grounding-line stability and ice-flow dynamics.},

  abstract = {Thinning ice in West Antarctica, resulting from acceleration in the flow of outlet glaciers, is at present contributing about 10\% of the observed rise in global sea level1. Pine Island Glacier in particular has shown nearly continuous acceleration2, 3 and thinning4, 5, throughout the short observational record. The floating ice shelf that forms where the glacier reaches the coast has been thinning rapidly6, driven by changes in ocean heat transport beneath it. As a result, the line that separates grounded and floating ice has retreated inland7. These events have been postulated as the cause for the inland thinning and acceleration8, 9. Here we report evidence gathered by an autonomous underwater vehicle operating beneath the ice shelf that Pine Island Glacier was recently grounded on a transverse ridge in the sea floor. Warm sea water now flows through a widening gap above the submarine ridge, rapidly melting the thick ice of the newly formed upstream half of the ice shelf. The present evolution of Pine Island Glacier is thus part of a longer-term trend that has moved the downstream limit of grounded ice inland by 30\hspace{0.167em}km, into water that is 300\hspace{0.167em}m deeper than over the ridge crest. The pace and ultimate extent of such potentially unstable retreat10 are central to the debate over the possibility of widespread ice-sheet collapse triggered by climate change},

Areas in the Bindschadler Ice Stream also exhibited comparable upward and downward surface displacements. As the uplift and subsidence features correspond to sites at which the basal water apparently experiences a hydraulic potential well, we suggest transient movement of pockets of subglacial water as the most likely cause for the vertical surface displacements. These results, and related lidar observations, imply that imaging the change in ice surface elevation can help reveal the key role of water in the difficult-to-observe subglacial environment, and its important influence on ice dynamics.},

  abstract = {The radial orbit error has long been the major error source in ERS-1 altimetry, crippled by having only satellite laser ranging for precise tracking and relying on insufficiently accurate general-purpose gravity field models. Altimeter crossovers are used very effectively as additional tracking data to laser ranging. The ERS Tandem Mission even provides the unique possibility to simultaneously determine orbits of two similar satellites flying the same orbit. Altimeter crossovers between the two satellites then link the two orbits into a common reference frame. Tailoring of the Joint Gravity Model 3 (JGM 3) is another step to reduce orbit errors. This technique is aimed at the reduction of the geographically anticorrelated orbit error (observed in the crossover height differences) through the adjustment of selected gravity field parameters. The resulting Delft Gravity Model (DGM)-E04 has reduced this part of the orbit error by a factor of 2, performs even better with respect to the ESA-provided orbits, and also outperforms the recent Earth Geopotential Model EGM96 in this respect. ERS-1 and ERS-2 orbits for the entire Tandem Mission are computed and studied in detail, and orbit errors due to the gravity field and nonconservative forces are identified. Analyses systematically show that the orbits computed with JGM 3 have a radial root-mean-square orbit accuracy of 7 cm, with DGM-E04 5 cm.},

  abstract = {The extent and duration of surface melting on the Antarctic ice shelves and margins of the Antarctic ice sheet are derived from satellite passive-microwave data for 1978-87. The occurrence of surface melting in daily maps of T-b is indicated by a marked increase in microwave brightness temperature (T-b), which is caused by moisture in the near-surface firn. T-b increases of more than 30 deg above the annual-mean T-b are chosen to indicate melting. Most Antarctic surface melting occurs during December and January. The observed melting is correlated with regional air temperatures, but some melt patterns also appear to be related to katabatic-wind effects. The correlations suggest that the surface melting in Antarctica increases about 3.5 x 10(6) d km(2) per degree of summer temperature increase. The surface-melt index (duration times area of melting) calculated for Antarctica is 24 x 10(6) d km(2), averaged over nine summers. The observed inter-annual and regional variability is large. Surface melting was most extensive during the 1982/83 summer (36 x 10(6) d km(2)) and least extensive during the 1985/86 summer (15 x 10(6) d km(2)). The data indicate a decline in surface melting over the 9 years, but meaningful inferences regarding trends in surface melting are precluded by the large inter-annual variability.},

  abstract = {The catastrophic collapses of Larsen A and B ice shelves on the eastern Antarctic Peninsula have caused their tributary glaciers to accelerate, contributing to sea-level rise and freshening the Antarctic Bottom Water formed nearby. The surface of Larsen C Ice Shelf (LCIS), the largest ice shelf on the peninsula, is lowering. This could be caused by unbalanced ocean melting (ice loss) or enhanced firn melting and compaction (englacial air loss). Using a novel method to analyse eight radar surveys, this study derives separate estimates of ice and air thickness changes during a 15 year period. The uncertainties are considerable, but the primary estimate is that the surveyed lowering (0.066 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.017 m yr-1) is caused by both ice loss (0.28 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.18 m yr-1) and firn air loss (0.037 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.026 m yr-1). Though the ice loss is much larger, ice and air loss contribute approximately equally to the lowering. The ice loss could be explained by high basal melting and/or ice divergence, and the air loss by low surface accumulation or high surface melting and/or compaction. The primary estimate therefore requires that at least two forcings caused the surveyed lowering.  Mechanisms are discussed by which LCIS stability could be compromised in future, suggesting destabilisation timescales of a few centuries. The most rapid pathways to collapse are offered by a flow perturbation arising from the ungrounding of LCIS from Bawden Ice Rise, or ice-front retreat past a "compressive arch" in strain rates.},

These tools allow for evaluation of crossover errors at intersections, analysis of such crossover errors to determine appropriate linear models of systematic corrections for each track, and application of these corrections and further adjustments to data that completely eliminates crossover discrepancies from final 2-D data compilations. Unlike my older x\_system tools, the new x2sys tools implement modern algorithms for detecting track intersections and are capable of reading a wide range of data file formats, including data files following the netCDF COARDS convention. The x2sys package contains several programs that address the various tasks needed to undertake a comprehensive crossover analysis and is distributed as a supplement to the Generic Mapping Tools, making them available for all computer platforms and architectures. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The analysis of univariate or multivariate time series provides crucial information to describe, understand, and predict climatic variability. The discovery and implementation of a number of novel methods for extracting useful information from time series has recently revitalized this classical field of study. Considerable progress has also been made in interpreting the information so obtained in terms of dynamical systems theory. In this review we describe the connections between time series analysis and nonlinear dynamics, discuss signal- to-noise enhancement, and present some of the novel methods for spectral analysis. The various steps, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of these methods, are illustrated by their application to an important climatic time series, the Southern Oscillation Index. This index captures major features of interannual climate variability and is used extensively in its prediction. Regional and global sea surface temperature data sets are used to illustrate multivariate spectral methods. Open questions and further prospects conclude the review.},

  abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The "lasso" minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly zero and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.

  abstract = {Antarctic ice sheet mass loss has been linked to an increase in oceanic heat supply, which enhances basal melt and thinning of ice shelves. Here we detail the interaction of modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) with the Amery Ice Shelf, the largest ice shelf in East Antarctica, and provide the first estimates of basal melting due to mCDW. We use subice shelf ocean observations from a borehole site (AM02) situated \ensuremath{\sim}70 km inshore of the ice shelf front, together with open ocean observations in Prydz Bay. We find that mCDW transport into the cavity is about 0.22\hspace{0.167em}\ensuremath{\pm}\hspace{0.167em}0.06 Sv (1 Sv\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}106 m3 s-1). The inflow of mCDW drives a net basal melt rate of up to 2\hspace{0.167em}\ensuremath{\pm}\hspace{0.167em}0.5 m yr-1 during 2001 (23.9\hspace{0.167em}\ensuremath{\pm}\hspace{0.167em}6.52 Gt yr-1 from under about 12,800 km2 of the north-eastern flank of the ice shelf). The heat content flux by mCDW at AM02 shows high intra-annual variability (up to 40\%). Our results suggest two main modes of subice shelf circulation and basal melt regimes: (1) the {\textquotedblleft}ice pump{\textquotedblright}/high salinity shelf water circulation, on the western flank and (2) the mCDW meltwater-driven circulation in conjunction with the {\textquotedblleft}ice pump,{\textquotedblright} on the eastern flank. These results highlight the sensitivity of the Amery's basal melting to changes in mCDW inflow. Improved understanding of such ice shelf-ocean interaction is crucial to refining projections of mass loss and associated sea level rise.},

  abstract = {We have tested three methods for estimating 2003-2008 elevation changes of Svalbard glaciers from multi-temporal ICESat laser altimetry: (a) linear interpolation of crossover points between ascending and descending tracks, (b) projection of near repeat-tracks onto common locations using Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), and (c) least-squares fitting of rigid planes to segments of repeat-track data assuming a constant elevation change rate. The two repeat-track methods yield similar results and compare well to the more accurate, but sparsely sampled, crossover points. Most glacier regions in Svalbard have experienced low-elevation thinning combined with high-elevation balance or thickening during 2003-2008. The geodetic mass balance (excluding calving front retreat or advance) of Svalbard's 34,600km2 glaciers is estimated to be -4.3??1.4 Gt y-1, corresponding to an area-averaged water equivalent (w.e.) balance of -0.12??0.04m w.e. y-1. The largest ice losses have occurred in the west and south, while northeastern Spitsbergen and the Austfonna ice cap have gained mass. Winter and summer elevation changes derived from the same methods indicate that the spatial gradient in mass balance is mainly due to a larger summer season thinning in the west and the south than in the northeast. Our findings are consistent with in-situ mass balance measurements from the same period, confirming that repeat-track satellite altimetry can be a valuable tool for monitoring short term elevation changes of Arctic glaciers. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

The rapid collapse of the northernmost section of the Larsen Ice Shelf (Larsen A), over a few days in January 1995, indicated that, after retreat beyond a critical limit, ice shelves may disintegrate rapidly. Here we use a finite-element numerical model that treats ice as a continuum without fracture(10) to examine the breakup history(2) between 1986 and 1997 of the two northern sections of Larsen Ice Shelf (Larsen A and Larsen B), from which we establish stability criteria for ice shelves. Analysis of various ice-shelf configurations reveals characteristic patterns in the strain rates near the ice front which we use to describe the stability of the ice shelf. On Larsen A, only the initial and final ice-front configurations show a stable pattern. Larsen B at present exhibits a stable pattern, hut if the ice front were to retreat by a further Few kilometres, it too is Likely to enter an irreversible retreat phase.},

  abstract = {In the theory of stochastic processes, the Karhunen{\textendash}Lo{\`e}ve theorem (named after Kari Karhunen and Michel Lo{\`e}ve), also known as the Kosambi{\textendash}Karhunen{\textendash}Lo{\`e}ve theorem is a representation of a stochastic process as an infinite linear combination of orthogonal functions, analogous to a Fourier series representation of a function on a bounded interval. Stochastic processes given by infinite series of this form were first considered by Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi. There exist many such expansions of a stochastic process: if the process is indexed over {[}a, b], any orthonormal basis of L2({[}a, b]) yields an expansion thereof in that form. The importance of the Karhunen{\textendash}Lo{\`e}ve theorem is that it yields the best such basis in the sense that it minimizes the total mean squared error.
In contrast to a Fourier series where the coefficients are fixed numbers and the expansion basis consists of sinusoidal functions (that is, sine and cosine functions), the coefficients in the Karhunen{\textendash}Lo{\`e}ve theorem are random variables and the expansion basis depends on the process. In fact, the orthogonal basis functions used in this representation are determined by the covariance function of the process. One can think that the Karhunen{\textendash}Lo{\`e}ve transform adapts to the process in order to produce the best possible basis for its expansion.
In the case of a centered stochastic process \{Xt\}t \ensuremath{\in} {[}a, b] (centered means E{[}Xt] = 0 for all t \ensuremath{\in} {[}a, b]) satisfying a technical continuity condition, Xt admits a decomposition

where Zk are pairwise uncorrelated random variables and the functions ek are continuous real-valued functions on {[}a, b] that are pairwise orthogonal in L2({[}a, b]). It is therefore sometimes said that the expansion is bi-orthogonal since the random coefficients Zk are orthogonal in the probability space while the deterministic functions ek are orthogonal in the time domain. The general case of a process Xt that is not centered can be brought back to the case of a centered process by considering Xt - E{[}Xt] which is a centered process.
Moreover, if the process is Gaussian, then the random variables Zk are Gaussian and stochastically independent. This result generalizes the Karhunen{\textendash}Lo{\`e}ve transform. An important example of a centered real stochastic process on {[}0, 1] is the Wiener process; the Karhunen{\textendash}Lo{\`e}ve theorem can be used to provide a canonical orthogonal representation for it. In this case the expansion consists of sinusoidal functions.
The above expansion into uncorrelated random variables is also known as the Karhunen{\textendash}Lo{\`e}ve expansion or Karhunen{\textendash}Lo{\`e}ve decomposition. The empirical version (i.e., with the coefficients computed from a sample) is known as the Karhunen{\textendash}Lo{\`e}ve transform (KLT), principal component analysis, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), Empirical orthogonal functions (a term used in meteorology and geophysics), or the Hotelling transform.},

  abstract = {The appearance of unusually warm surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean during El Ni{\~n}o is one of the most prominent aspects of oceanic variability in the tropics. It is also the most important feature of El Ni{\~n}o because sea surface temperature is the only oceanic parameter that significantly affects the atmosphere. Advection strongly influences sea surface temperatures over much of the tropical Pacific, and especially in the eastern part of the basin. Warming by advection competes with cooling caused by upwelling. The prevailing trade winds drive poleward Ekman drift and hence, induce equatorial upwelling leading to a tongue of cold surface waters along the equator. The heat flux across the ocean surface, advection, upwelling, and mixing processes influence sea surface temperatures in the tropical oceans. A change in the balance between these processes causes sea surface temperature variations. On interannual and seasonal time scales, such a change in the balance reflects profound changes in the circulation of the entire tropical Pacific Ocean. The circulation is determined primarily by the surface winds. Hence, to understand El Ni{\~n}o and the seasonal cycle{\textemdash}these two phenomena have much in common{\textemdash}it is necessary to understand how the ocean responds to variable winds.},

The surface elevations were obtained from computer retracking of the radar altimeter waveforms, which were recorded at 0.1-s intervals corresponding to 662-m spacings on the surface. The precision of the elevation measurements before adjustment for radial orbit errors is 1.9 m as shown by analysis of elevation differences at orbital crossover points. This precision is partly determined by radial errors of approximately 1.0 m in orbit determination and partly by noise due to ice surface irregularities. Adjustment of the radial components of the orbits to minimize the differences in elevations at crossovers over a small, relatively flat region reduces the rms difference to 0.25 m, which is indicative of the optimum precision obtainable over the ice sheets. However, the precision degrades as the slope of the surface or amplitude of the undulations increases, yielding an overall precision of \ensuremath{\pm}1.6 m. The preliminary contour maps are not corrected for slope-induced displacements. A 2-m contour map in a region of highest data density illustrates the three-dimensional characteristics of some surface undulations.},

  abstract = {We present a new technique for isolating climate signals in time series with a characteristic `red' noise background which arises from temporal persistence. This background is estimated by a `robust' procedure that, unlike conventional techniques, is largely unbiased by the presence of signals immersed in the noise. Making use of multiple-taper spectral analysis methods, the technique further provides for a distinction between purely harmonic (periodic) signals, and broader-band (`quasiperiodic') signals. The effectiveness of our signal detection procedure is demonstrated with synthetic examples that simulate a variety of possible periodic and quasiperiodic signals immersed in red noise. We apply our methodology to historical climate and paleoclimate time series examples. Analysis of a \ensuremath{\approx} 3 million year sediment core reveals significant periodic components at known astronomical forcing periodicities and a significant quasiperiodic 100 year peak. Analysis of a roughly 1500 year tree-ring reconstruction of Scandinavian summer temperatures suggests significant quasiperiodic signals on a near-century timescale, an interdecadal 16{\textendash}18 year timescale, within the interannual El Ni{\~n}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) band, and on a quasibiennial timescale. Analysis of the 144 year record of Great Salt Lake monthly volume change reveals a significant broad band of significant interdecadal variability, ENSO-timescale peaks, an annual cycle and its harmonics. Focusing in detail on the historical estimated global-average surface temperature record, we find a highly significant secular trend relative to the estimated red noise background, and weakly significant quasiperiodic signals within the ENSO band. Decadal and quasibiennial signals are marginally significant in this series.},

Smooth features coinciding with these troughs appeared in a synthetic aperture radar image acquired 18 months earlier. ERS-1 altimeter waveform sequences and backscatter measurements along repeat satellite ground tracks across the same section of the Amery Ice Shelf, for the 1993-94 summer, exhibited a dramatic change over a 2 km sector between 30 January and 2 February 1994. The change is consistent with the presence of liquid water on the ice-shelf surface, located in the deeper of the two troughs. A time series of special sensor microwave/ imager brightness temperatures over the Lambert Glacier-Amery Ice Shelf region for the same period has sharp maxima on 5 January and 21 January 1994.

Seismic surveys and investigations through boreholes have revealed a spatial association between fast ice flow and saturated deformable sediments. Nevertheless, our knowledge of the morphology of the interface between ice and sediments is still limited, resulting in only rudimentary understanding of the basal boundary conditions beneath ice streams and the generation of subglacial bedforms. Here we present radar data from the bed of a West Antarctic ice stream that reveal the presence of mega-scale glacial lineations. We combine these data with previously published seismic data and show that these lineations develop in areas of dilatant deforming till and are part of a dynamic sedimentary system that undergoes significant change by erosion and deposition on decadal timescales. We find that the mega-scale glacial lineations are indistinguishable from those found on beds of palaeo-ice streams, providing conclusive evidence for the hypothesis that highly elongate bedforms are a characteristic of fast-flow regions in ice sheets.},

  doi = {10.1029/2010JB008073},
  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that postseismic relaxation following the 2004 Mw6.0 Parkfield, CA, earthquake is dominated by afterslip. However, we show that some fraction of the afterslip inferred from kinematic inversion to have occurred immediately below the seismically ruptured area may in fact be a substitute for viscous postseismic deformation of the lower crust. Using continuous GPS and synthetic aperture radar interferometry, we estimate the relative contribution of shallow afterslip (at depth less than 20km) and deeper seated deformation required to account for observed postseismic surface displacements. Exploiting the possible separation in space and time of the time series of displacements predicted from viscoelastic relaxation, we devise a linear inversion scheme that allows inverting jointly for the contribution of afterslip and viscoelastic flow as a function of time. We find that a wide range of models involving variable amounts of viscoelastic deformation can fit the observations equally well provided that they allow some fraction of deep-seated deformation (at depth larger than \ensuremath{\sim}20 km). These models require that the moment released by postseismic relaxation over 5 years following the earthquake reached nearly as much as 200\% of the coseismic moment. All the models show a remarkable complementarity of coseismic and shallow afterslip distributions. Some significant deformation at lower crustal depth (20{\textendash}26 km) is required to fit the geodetic data. The condition that postseismic deformation cannot exceed complete relaxation places a constraint on the amount of deep seated deformation. The analysis requires an effective viscosity of at least \ensuremath{\sim}1018 Pa s of the lower crust (assuming a semi-infinite homogeneous viscous domain). This deep-seated deformation is consistent with the depth range of tremors which also show a transient postseismic response and could explain as much as 50\% of the total postseismic geodetic moment (the remaining fraction being due to afterslip at depth shallower than 20 km). Lower crustal postseismic deformation could reflect a combination of localized ductile deformation and aseismic frictional sliding.},

seasons leading to melt ponding on the shelf surfaces are the apparent cause of the
breakups. Enhanced fracturing of pre-existing crevasses and shelf rifts driven by
this meltwater occurs during warmer summers, leading to disintegration. Shelf
breakups in the Peninsula over the last 20 years, coupled with geological evidence
of their prior stability over the previous several millennia, imply that Peninsula
climate is warmer now than at any time during this period. Stability of the remaining
Peninsula shelves and other ice shelves can be assessed using remotely sensed
indicators based on the presented model of ice shelf breakup. We find that, among
11 Antarctic ice shelves fringing the continent, only the currently retreating
Larsen B, Wilkins, and George VI ice shelves, and the northernmost portions of
the Larsen C shelf (northeast of the Alexander Peninsula) have the firn characteristics

In Antarctica, most of these processes are reasonably well understood but have not been rigorously quantified. In Greenland, an understanding of the processes by which warmer ocean temperatures drive the observed retreat remains elusive.

  abstract = {Abstract This study statistically evaluates the relationship between Antarctic sea ice extent and global climate variability. Temporal cross correlations between detrended Antarctic sea ice edge (SIE) anomaly and various climate indices are calculated. For the sea surface temperature (SST) in the eastern equatorial Pacific and tropical Indian Ocean, as well as the tropical Pacific precipitation, a coherent propagating pattern is clearly evident in all correlations with the spatially averaged (over 12{\textdegree} longitude) detrended SIE anomalies (〈SIE*〉). Correlations with ENSO indices imply that up to 34\% of the variance in 〈SIE*〉 is linearly related to ENSO. The 〈SIE*〉 has even higher correlations with the tropical Pacific precipitation and SST in the tropical Indian Ocean. In addition, correlation of 〈SIE*〉 with global surface temperature produces four characteristic correlation patterns: 1) an ENSO-like pattern in the Tropics with strong correlations in the Indian Ocean and North America (r \ensuremath{>} 0.6); 2) a teleconnection pattern between the eastern Pacific region of the Antarctic and western{\textendash}central tropical Pacific; 3) an Antarctic dipole across the Drake Passage; and 4) meridional banding structures in the central Pacific and Atlantic expending from polar regions to the Tropics, even to the Northern Hemisphere. The SIE anomalies in the Amundsen Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, and Weddell Gyre of the Antarctic polar ocean sectors show the strongest polar links to extrapolar climate. Linear correlations between 〈SIE*〉 in those regions and global climate parameters pass a local significance test at the 95\% confidence level. The field significance, designed to account for spatial coherence in the surface temperature, is evaluated using quasiperiodic colored noise that is more appropriate than white noise. The fraction of the globe displaying locally significant correlations (at the 95\% confidence level) between 〈SIE*〉 and global temperature is significantly larger, at the 99.5\% confidence level, than the fraction expected given quasiperiodic colored noise in place of the 〈SIE*〉. Based on EOF analysis and multiplicity theory, the four teleconnection patterns the authors found are the ones reflecting correlations most likely to be physically meaningful.},

This is because the melting process cools and dilutes the oceans on average, and unless these opposing effects exactly balance each other there will be a net change in the ocean density. We discuss how these subtle effects can be quantified and put bounds on the potential sea level rise associated with melting of the ice masses that are currently afloat in the world's oceans.},

The reconstruction is an attempt to narrow the current broad range of sea level rise estimates, to identify any pattern of regional sea level rise, and to determine any variation in the rate of sea level rise over the 51-yr period. The computed rate of global-averaged sea level rise from the reconstructed monthly time series is 1.8 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.3 mm yr-1. With the decadal variability in the computed global mean sea level, it is not possible to detect a significant increase in the rate of sea level rise over the period 1950{\textendash}2000. A regional pattern of sea level rise is identified. The maximum sea level rise is in the eastern off-equatorial Pacific and there is a minimum along the equator, in the western Pacific, and in the eastern Indian Ocean. A greater rate of sea level rise on the eastern North American coast compared with the United Kingdom and the Scandinavian peninsula is also found. The major sources of uncertainty are the inadequate historical distribution of tide gauges, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere, inadequate information on tide gauge signals from processes such as postglacial rebound and tectonic activity, and the short satellite altimeter record available to estimate global sea level covariance functions. The results demonstrate that tide gauge records will continue to complement satellite altimeter records for observing and understanding sea level change.},

Almost all drainage basins in east Antarctica had average dH/dt values within \&plusmn;3.0 cm/year, whereas drainage basins in west Antarctica had substantial spatial variability with average dH/dt values ranging between -11 to +12 cm/year. The east Antarctic ice sheet had a five-year trend of 1\&plusmn;0.6 cm/year, where 13 out of the 14 basins had either a positive trend or a trend that was not significantly different than zero. The west Antarctic ice sheet had a five-year trend of -3.6\&plusmn;1.0 cm/year due largely to strong negative trends of around 10 cm/year for basins in Marie Byrd Land along the Pacific sector of the Antarctic coast. The continent as a whole had a five-year dH/dt trend of 0.4\&plusmn;0.4 cm/year. Finally, time series constructed for the Pine Island, Thwaites, De Vicq, and Land glaciers in west Antarctic showed five-year dH/dt trends from -26 to -135 cm/year that were significantly more negative than the average dH/dt trends in their respective basins. The strongly negative dH/dt values for these coastal glacier outlets are consistent with recently reported results indicating increased basal melting at these glaciers' grounding lines caused by ocean thermal forcing.},

Special emphasis is placed on various difficulties encountered in the production of ERA-40, including the representation of the hydrological cycle, the quality of the stratospheric circulation, and the consistency in time of the reanalysed fields.

The individual records exhibit highly significant oscillatory modes with spectral peaks at 7{\textendash}8 yr and in the quasi-biennial and quasi-quadrennial bands.The interactions between the three regions were investigated in the light of the synchronization theory of chaotic oscillators. The theory was applied here by combining multichannel singular-spectrum analysis (M-SSA) with a recently introduced varimax rotation of the M-SSA eigenvectors.A key result is that the 7{\textendash}8-yr and 2.7-yr oscillatory modes in all three regions are synchronized, at least in part. The energy-ratio analysis, as well as time-lag results, suggests that the NAO plays a leading role in the 7{\textendash}8-yr mode. It was found therewith that the South Asian monsoon is not slaved to forcing from the equatorial Pacific, although it does interact strongly with it. The time-lag analysis pinpointed this to be the case in particular for the quasi-biennial oscillatory modes.Overall, these results confirm that the approach of synchronized oscillators, combined with varimax-rotated M-SSA, is a powerful tool in studying teleconnections between regional climate modes and that it helps identify the mechanisms that operate in various frequency bands. This approach should be readily applicable to ocean modes of variability and to the problems of air{\textendash}sea interaction as well.},

The contribution of these smaller glaciers has accelerated over the past decade, in part due to marked thinning and retreat of marine-terminating glaciers associated with a dynamic instability that is generally not considered in mass-balance and climate modeling. This acceleration of glacier melt may cause 0.1 to 0.25 meter of additional sea-level rise by 2100.},

  abstract = {We present an autoregressive (AR) model that can effectively characterize both seasonal and interannual variations in ice sheet elevation change time series constructed from satellite radar or laser altimeter data. The AR model can be used in conjunction with weighted least squares regression to accurately estimate any longer term linear trend present in the cyclically varying elevation change time series. This approach is robust in that it can account for seasonal and interannual elevation change variations, missing points in the time series, signal aperiodicity, time series heteroscedasticity, and time series with a noninteger number of yearly cycles. In addition, we derive a theoretically valid estimate of the uncertainty (standard error) in the long-term linear trend. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted that closely emulated actual characteristics of five-year elevation change time series from Antarctica. The Monte Carlo results indicate that the autoregressive approach yields long-term linear trends that are less biased than two other approaches that have been recently used for analysis of ice sheet elevation change time series. In addition, the simulation results demonstrate that the variability (uncertainty) of the long-term linear trend estimates from the AR approach is in very good agreement with the derived theoretical standard error estimates.},

Here we present new, spatially extensive observations of the vertical tidal motion of the Filchner-Ronne and Larsen C ice shelves using Global Positioning System (GPS) data spanning a few weeks to years. We pay particular attention to the major tidal constituents (M2, S2, O1, K1) as well as important GRACE aliasing periods (K2 and S1). We compare the estimated constituents with recent global and regional tide models and find that no single model is the most accurate across all constituents or ice shelves. The root-sum-square errors are 7{\textendash}8 cm (CATS2008a and TPXO7.2) and 11{\textendash}12 cm (GOT4.7 and FES2004) with the energetic M2 (RMSE = 4{\textendash}8 cm) and S2 (4{\textendash}5 cm) generally dominating these statistics. The FES2004 K1 is particularly inaccurate near the Larsen C Ice Shelf, with errors approaching 20 cm, meaning that GRACE Release 4 estimates of mass change in the northern Antarctic Peninsula will be biased. We find tidal energy at 3, 4, 5, 6 and, weakly, at 7 cycles per day at all of our sites. The largest amplitudes within these bands are at M4, MO3 and SP3 and approach 30 mm, although significant spatial variations exist. We show that they generally do not appear to originate in areas of reduced water column in ice shelf grounding zones. Comparing model estimates with our M4, MS4 and MN4 values shows that models do not accurately represent these terms.},

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of global sea-level rise requires that we understand the cause of recent, widespread and intensifying glacier acceleration along Antarctic ice-sheet coastal margins. Atmospheric and oceanic forcing have the potential to reduce the thickness and extent of floating ice shelves, potentially limiting their ability to buttress the flow of grounded tributary glaciers. Indeed, recent ice-shelf collapse led to retreat and acceleration of several glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula. But the extent and magnitude of ice-shelf thickness change, the underlying causes of such change, and its link to glacier flow rate are so poorly understood that its future impact on the ice sheets cannot yet be predicted. Here we use satellite laser altimetry and modelling of the surface firn layer to reveal the circum-Antarctic pattern of ice-shelf thinning through increased basal melt. We deduce that this increased melt is the primary control of Antarctic ice-sheet loss, through a reduction in buttressing of the adjacent ice sheet leading to accelerated glacier flow. The highest thinning rates occur where warm water at depth can access thick ice shelves via submarine troughs crossing the continental shelf. Wind forcing could explain the dominant patterns of both basal melting and the surface melting and collapse of Antarctic ice shelves, through ocean upwelling in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen seas, and atmospheric warming on the Antarctic Peninsula. This implies that climate forcing through changing winds influences Antarctic ice-sheet mass balance, and hence global sea level, on annual to decadal timescales.},

  abstract = {In 1994, ocean measurements near Antarctica's Pine Island Glacier showed that the ice shelf buttressing the glacier was melting rapidly1. This melting was attributed to the presence of relatively warm, deep water on the Amundsen Sea continental shelf. Heat, salt and ice budgets along with ocean modelling provided steady-state calving and melting rates2, 3. Subsequent satellite observations and modelling have indicated large system imbalances, including ice-shelf thinning and more intense melting, glacier acceleration and drainage basin drawdown4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Here we combine our earlier data with measurements taken in 2009 to show that the temperature and volume of deep water in Pine Island Bay have increased. Ocean transport and tracer calculations near the ice shelf reveal a rise in meltwater production by about 50\% since 1994. The faster melting seems to result mainly from stronger sub-ice-shelf circulation, as thinning ice has increased the gap above an underlying submarine bank on which the glacier was formerly grounded11. We conclude that the basal melting has exceeded the increase in ice inflow, leading to the formation and enlargement of an inner cavity under the ice shelf within which sea water nearly 4 {\textdegree}C above freezing can now more readily access the grounding zone.},

These changes have led to the collapse of ice shelves and retreat, acceleration, and thinning of inland ice. However, ocean observations in the center of the nearby Bellingshausen Sea are spatially and temporally coarse. In this study, ocean and sea ice models forced by atmospheric reanalyses are used to investigate this data gap by simulating processes in the Bellingshausen Sea for the years 1979{\textendash}2007. The model suggests flow features in the region and predicts the basal melting of local ice shelves. Modeled ocean conditions are found to be less variable than in the nearby Amundsen Sea, which is situated closer to foci of annual and interannual atmospheric variability. Melt rates beneath George VI Ice Shelf are investigated in detail, concluding that the ice shelf may have been melting out of balance (and therefore thinning) for decades. The melt rate contains significant interannual variability that the model links to variation in sea ice conditions offshore of the southern end of the ice shelf. This stands in contrast to the Amundsen Sea, where models suggest that ice shelf melting is controlled by variable transport of Circumpolar Deep Water onto the continental shelf.},

  abstract = {Abstract A computationally efficient relocatable system for generalized inverse (GI) modeling of barotropic ocean tides is described. The GI penalty functional is minimized using a representer method, which requires repeated solution of the forward and adjoint linearized shallow water equations (SWEs). To make representer computations efficient, the SWEs are solved in the frequency domain by factoring the coefficient matrix for a finite-difference discretization of the second-order wave equation in elevation. Once this matrix is factored representers can be calculated rapidly. By retaining the first-order SWE system (defined in terms of both elevations and currents) in the definition of the discretized GI penalty functional, complete generality in the choice of dynamical error covariances is retained. This allows rational assumptions about errors in the SWE, with soft momentum balance constraints (e.g., to account for inaccurate parameterization of dissipation), but holds mass conservation constraints. While the dynamical calculations involve elevations alone, depth-averaged currents can be directly assimilated into the tidal model with this approach. The efficient representer calculation forms the basis for the Oregon State University (OSU) Tidal Inversion Software (OTIS). OTIS includes software for generating grids, prior model covariances, and boundary conditions; for time stepping the nonlinear shallow water equations to generate a first guess or prior solution; for preliminary processing of TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter data; for solution of the GI problem; and for computation of posterior error bars. Approximate GI solution methods, based on using a reduced set of representers, allow very large datasets to be inverted. OTIS regional and local GI tidal modeling (with grids containing up to 105 nodes) require only a few hours on a common desktop workstation. Use of OTIS is illustrated by developing a new regional-scale (1/6{\textdegree}) model of tides in the Indonesian Seas.},

  abstract = {Many glaciers along the margins of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are accelerating and, for this reason, contribute increasingly to global sea-level rise. Globally, ice losses contribute approximately 1.8 mm yr(-1) (ref. 8), but this could increase if the retreat of ice shelves and tidewater glaciers further enhances the loss of grounded ice or initiates the large-scale collapse of vulnerable parts of the ice sheets. Ice loss as a result of accelerated flow, known as dynamic thinning, is so poorly understood that its potential contribution to sea level over the twenty-first century remains unpredictable. Thinning on the ice-sheet scale has been monitored by using repeat satellite altimetry observations to track small changes in surface elevation, but previous sensors could not resolve most fast-flowing coastal glaciers. Here we report the use of high-resolution ICESat (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite) laser altimetry to map change along the entire grounded margins of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. To isolate the dynamic signal, we compare rates of elevation change from both fast-flowing and slow-flowing ice with those expected from surface mass-balance fluctuations. We find that dynamic thinning of glaciers now reaches all latitudes in Greenland, has intensified on key Antarctic grounding lines, has endured for decades after ice-shelf collapse, penetrates far into the interior of each ice sheet and is spreading as ice shelves thin by ocean-driven melt. In Greenland, glaciers flowing faster than 100 m yr(-1) thinned at an average rate of 0.84 m yr(-1), and in the Amundsen Sea embayment of Antarctica, thinning exceeded 9.0 m yr(-1) for some glaciers. Our results show that the most profound changes in the ice sheets currently result from glacier dynamics at ocean margins.},

  abstract = {Progressive increase in ice discharge from fastest Greenland/Antarctic glaciers Key imortance of floating ice shelves to future behavior of many similar glacier Likelihood of continued, very large increases in ice discharge Ice discharge from the fastest glaciers draining the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets Jakobshavn Isbrae (JI) and Pine Island Glacier (PIG) continues to increase, and is now more than double that needed to balance snowfall in their catchment basins. Velocity increase probably resulted from decreased buttressing from thinning (and, for JI, breakup) of their floating ice tongues, and from reduced basal drag as grounding lines on both glaciers retreat. JI flows directly into the ocean as it becomes afloat, and here creep rates are proportional to the cube of bed depth. Rapid thinning of the PIG ice shelf increases the likelihood of its breakup, and subsequent rapid increase in discharge velocity. Results from a simple model indicate that JI velocities should almost double to \ensuremath{>}20 km a1 by 2015, with velocities on PIG increasing to \ensuremath{>}10 km a1 after breakup of its ice shelf. These high velocities would probably be sustained over many decades as the glaciers retreat within their long, very deep troughs. Resulting sea-level rise would average about 1.5 mm a1.},

  abstract = {Abstract Objective analysis of altimetric data (sea level anomaly) usually assumes that measurement errors are well represented by a white noise, though there are long-wavelength errors that are correlated over thousands of kilometers along the satellite tracks. These errors are typically 3 cm rms for TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P), which is not negligible in low-energy regions. Analyzing maps produced by conventional objective analysis thus reveals residual long-wavelength errors in the form of tracks on the maps. These errors induce sea level gradients perpendicular to the track and, therefore, high geostrophic velocities that can obscure ocean features. To overcome this problem, an improved objective analysis method that takes into account along-track correlated errors is developed. A specific data selection is used to allow an efficient correction of long-wavelength errors while estimating the oceanic signal. The influence of data selection is analyzed, and the method is first tested with simulated data. The method is then applied to real T/P and ERS-1 data in the Canary Basin (a region typical of low eddy energy regions), and the results are compared to those of a conventional objective analysis method. The correction for the along-track long-wavelength error has a very significant effect. For T/P and ERS-1 separately, the mapping difference between the two methods is about 2 cm rms (20\% of the signal variance). The variance of the difference in zonal and meridional velocities is roughly 30\% and 60\%, respectively, of the velocity signal variance. The effect is larger when T/P and ERS-1 are combined. Correcting the long-wavelength error also considerably improves the consistency between the T/P and ERS-1 datasets. The variance of the difference (T/P{\textendash}ERS-1) is reduced by a factor of 1.7 for the sea level, 1.6 for zonal velocities, and 2.3 for meridional velocities. The method is finally applied globally to T/P data. It is shown that it is tractable at the global scale and that it provides an improved mapping.},

Thus, the high correlation found in ERA40, and previously in other chronologically realistic data, in the late 1980s and the 1990s may not be expected to last. Unlike previously suggested by others, the sign of the correlation between ENSO indices and west Antarctic precipitation, when significant, does not appear to change in time: Precipitation variability at the ENSO pace in the Bellingshausen-Weddell (Ross-Amunsden) region is consistently in phase (phase opposition, respectively) with the Southern Oscillation Index. This is consistent with a tropospheric wave train connecting the tropical Pacific and west Antarctic regions, which modulates in phase opposition the advection of air and moisture in the 2 regions.},

Satellite remote-sensing data of ice elevations and ice motion show significant ice loss in the range of -31 to -196 Gt yr-1 in West Antarctica in recent years1, 2, 3, 4, whereas East Antarctica seems to remain in balance or slightly gain mass1, 2, 4, with estimated rates of mass change in the range of -4 to 22 Gt yr-1. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment5 (GRACE) offers the opportunity of quantifying polar ice-sheet mass balance from a different perspective6, 7. Here we use an extended record of GRACE data spanning the period April 2002 to January 2009 to quantify the rates of Antarctic ice loss. In agreement with an independent earlier assessment4, we estimate a total loss of 190\ensuremath{\pm}77 Gt yr-1, with 132\ensuremath{\pm}26 Gt yr-1 coming from West Antarctica. However, in contrast with previous GRACE estimates, our data suggest that East Antarctica is losing mass, mostly in coastal regions, at a rate of -57\ensuremath{\pm}52 Gt yr-1, apparently caused by increased ice loss since the year 2006.},

The reflection of wave incident on the western boundary of an ocean basin involves a Kelvin or Rossby-gravity wave, depending on the symmetry of the incident wave.

  abstract = {The integrated program Surface Elevation Reconstruction And Change detection (SERAC) was specifically designed and developed for detecting surface elevation and elevation changes from the Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat). ICESat carried geoscience laser altimeter system (GLAS) with the primary goal of measuring elevation changes of the polar ice sheets to sufficient accuracy to assess their impact on global sea level. GLAS had three lasers that operated sequentially, with two to three campaigns per year. The footprint size was about 70 m and the point-to-point spacing between neighboring laser points reached 170 m. SERAC copes with different scenarios. Originally developed for calculating surface elevation changes of crossover areas, it was extended to along-track areas and the inclusion of non-ICESat laser data, such as Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM), an airborne laser scanning system developed by NASA Wallops Flight Facility. The adjustment system of SERAC simultaneously computes the shape of surface patches containing laser points of the same time epoch, estimates surface elevation changes, and approximates the time series of elevation changes by a polynomial after removing the seasonal cycle. Results shown in the second part of the paper demonstrate the potential of SERAC for calculating detailed ice sheet elevation and volume change histories. Greenland Ice Sheet volume changes, calculated from a combined ICESat/ATM data set, show good agreement with previously published results and provide improved sampling in the rapidly thinning coastal regions of southern Greenland. Moreover, the polynomial approximation of the time series of surface elevation changes is taken to advantage in the last example of Northwest Greenland, illuminating the intricate thinning/thickening patterns that often vary considerably over short spatial scales.},

In contrast, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) rests on ground that is predominantly below sea level, and its configuration is considered unstable due to the inland-sloping bedrock geometry, a heightened exposure to oceanic perturbations, and the presence of deformable sediments beneath major outlet glaciers (Alley Whillans, 1991). Here, we determine the volume change of Antarctic outlet glaciers between 1992 and 2003 to characterise the ice sheet mass balance. We conclude that only glaciers of a certain geometry-those seated in submarine basins with no substantial ice shelf barrier-are losing mass today. These glaciers are sited in both East and West Antarctica and, because they are susceptible to changes in climate, we anticipate they will provide a substantial contribution to global sea levels over the twenty-first century should ocean warming continue as projected (Gille, 2002).},

This is due to its integration of many new features. In particular, the RA-2 is the first satellite altimeter to incorporate autonomous resolution selection and a model-free tracker. The behavior of the instrument in orbit is controlled by onboard algorithms which determine the instrument logic, and a list of onboard parameters which control when switches in resolution occur. This logic and the choice of these parameters have a strong influence on the tracking performance. This paper describes the operation of the RA-2 onboard tracker and the resolution selection logic. We provide a detailed description of the algorithm and its configuration parameters after optimization during the EnviSat Commissioning Phase. Finally, we show the tracking performance, in particular compared to the ones of the ERS-2 altimeter, over different types of surfaces.},

The lowering is explained by increased summer melt-water and the loss of basal ice through melting.

Multiple images of all areas are combined in a data cumulation scheme to improve spatial resolution and increase radiometric content of the mosaics. The component images were de-striped, geo-registered, and re-sampled to the projection grid using the MODIS Swath-to-Grid Toolbox (MS2GT) software. A 125~m ground-equivalent polar stereographic projection was used, identical to previous radar image mosaics and similar to several other continent-wide data sets. Geo-location accuracy of the final mosaics is better than 125~m. Swath acquisition times were limited to the range 05:00{\textendash}13:30 UT to provide broad but uniform mosaic illumination. Regions of cloud cover, blowing snow, and intense forward scattering were masked prior to compositing. The MOA snow grain size data set image provides the first continent-wide semi-quantitative map of mean summer snow, firn, and blue ice grain size. Optical grain size (radius) was determined using a normalized difference index derived from MODIS band 1 and band 2~rad values. Atmospheric correction, adjustments for directional reflectance variation and snow grain size estimation were accomplished by a look-up table, generated by a combination of published models of snow spectral reflectance and atmosphere radiative transfer. Validation of the snow grain size image is provided by in situ spectra of snow-covered sea ice made in October, 2003. We use the new data sets to determine major ice shelf areas, and shelf edge, coastline, and ice grounding line vector files, and determine areas of selected blue ice regions.

We show that the pattern of thinning has both accelerated and spread inland to encompass tributaries flowing into the central trunk of the glacier. Within the 5,400 km(2) central trunk, the average rate of volume loss quadrupled from 2.6 +/- 0.3 km(3) yr(-1) in 1995 to 10.1 +/- 0.3 km(3) yr(-1) in 2006. The region of lightly grounded ice at the glacier terminus is extending upstream, and the changes inland are consistent with the effects of a prolonged disturbance to the ice flow, such as the effects of ocean- driven melting. If the acceleration continues at its present rate, the main trunk of PIG will be afloat within some 100 years, six times sooner than anticipated. Citation: Wingham, D.J., D.W. Wallis, and A.

  abstract = {Ice sheets are expected to shrink in size as the world warms, which in turn will raise sea level. The West Antarctic ice sheet is of particular concern, because it was probably much smaller at times during the past million years when temperatures were comparable to levels that might be reached or exceeded within the next few centuries. Much of the grounded ice in West Antarctica lies on a bed that deepens inland and extends well below sea level. Oceanic and atmospheric warming threaten to reduce or eliminate the floating ice shelves that buttress the ice sheet at present. Loss of the ice shelves would accelerate the flow of non-floating ice near the coast. Because of the slope of the sea bed, the consequent thinning could ultimately float much of the ice sheet's interior. In this scenario, global sea level would rise by more than three metres, at an unknown rate. Simplified analyses suggest that much of the ice sheet will survive beyond this century. We do not know how likely or inevitable eventual collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet is at this stage, but the possibility cannot be discarded. For confident projections of the fate of the ice sheet and the rate of any collapse, further work including the development of well-validated physical models will be required.

  abstract = {Geological data indicate that global mean sea level has fluctuated on 103 to 106 yr time scales during the last \ensuremath{\sim}25 million years, at times reaching 20 m or more above modern. If correct, this implies substantial variations in the size of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS). However, most climate and ice sheet models have not been able to simulate significant EAIS retreat from continental size, given that atmospheric CO2 levels were relatively low throughout this period. Here, we use a continental ice sheet model to show that mechanisms based on recent observations and analysis have the potential to resolve this model{\textendash}data conflict. In response to atmospheric and ocean temperatures typical of past warm periods, floating ice shelves may be drastically reduced or removed completely by increased oceanic melting, and by hydrofracturing due to surface melt draining into crevasses. Ice at deep grounding lines may be weakened by hydrofracturing and reduced buttressing, and may fail structurally if stresses exceed the ice yield strength, producing rapid retreat. Incorporating these mechanisms in our ice-sheet model accelerates the expected collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to decadal time scales, and also causes retreat into major East Antarctic subglacial basins, producing \ensuremath{\sim}17 m global sea-level rise within a few thousand years. The mechanisms are highly parameterized and should be tested by further process studies. But if accurate, they offer one explanation for past sea-level high stands, and suggest that Antarctica may be more vulnerable to warm climates than in most previous studies.},

Neural network theory has meanwhile allowed PCA to be generalized to nonlinear PCA (NLPCA). In this paper, NLPCA is further extended to perform nonlinear SSA (NLSSA): First, SSA is applied to reduce the dimension of the data set; the leading principal components (PCs) of the SSA then become inputs to an NLPCA network (with a circular node at the bottleneck). This network performs the NLSSA by nonlinearly combining all the input SSA PCs. The NLSSA is applied to the tropical Pacific sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) field and to the sea level pressure anomaly (SLPA) field for the 1950{\textendash}2000 period. Unlike SSA modes, which display warm and cool periods of similar duration and intensity, NLSSA mode 1 shows the warm periods to be shorter and more intense than the cool periods, as observed for the El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation. Also, in SSTA NLSSA mode 1 the peak warm event is centered in the eastern equatorial Pacific, while the peak cool event is located around the central equatorial Pacific, an asymmetry not found in the individual SSA modes. A quasi-triennial wave of about a 39 month period is found in NLSSA mode 2 of the SSTA and of the SLPA.},

produce surface-elevation maps of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets with a 2 m
accuracy. Analysis of Seas at and Geosat cross-over points showed that satellite
altimeters can measure changes in the mass balance of the ice sheets. The retracking
algorithm used to extract surface elevations from Seasat and Geosat return wave
forms is based upon a modified form of the Brown surfa ce-scattering model. Recent
work has shown that altimeter wave forms over higher-altitude regions of the ice
sheets are affected by sub-surface volume-scattering. Here, we develop a theoretical
model for altimeter return wave forms over the ice sheets that is based on a
combination of surface- and volume-scattering. By approximating the altimeter's
antenna pattern and transmitted pulse shape with Gaussian functions, we derive a
closed-form analytical solution for the return-power volume-scattered from beneath
the ice-sheet surface. We then combine the volume-scattering model with the Brown
model and apply it to average wave forms from the Greenland and Antarctic ice
sheets. The results show that the combined model accurately describes variations in
altimeter wave-form shapes that are produced by differing contributions of surfaceand
volume-scattering to the received power. The combined model is then used to
simulate return wave forms from a dual-frequency altimeter. The simulation shows
that a two-frequency system can provide quantitative estimates of the absorption and
scattering coefficients for near-surface snow.},

  abstract = {Around the perimeter of Antarctica, much of the ice sheet discharges to the ocean through floating ice shelves.  The buttressing provided by ice shelves is critical for modulating the flux of ice into the ocean, and the presently observed thinning of ice shelves is believed to be reducing their buttressing capacity and contributing to the acceleration and thinning of the grounded ice sheet.  However, relatively little attention has been paid to the role that fractures play in the ability of ice shelves to sustain and transmit buttressing stresses.  Here, we present a new framework for quantifying the role that fractures play in the creep deformation and buttressing capacity of ice shelves.  We apply principles of continuum damage mechanics to derive a new analytical relation for the creep of an ice shelf that accounts for the softening influence of fractures on longitudinal deformation using a state damage variable.  We use this new analytical relation, combined with a temperature calculation for the ice, to partition an inverse method solution for ice shelf rigidity into independent solutions for softening damage and stabilizing backstress.  Using this new approach, field and remote sensing data can be utilized to monitor the structural integrity of ice shelves, their ability to buttress the flow of ice at the grounding line, and thus their indirect contribution to ice sheet mass balance and global sea level.  We apply this technique to the Larsen C ice shelf using remote sensing and Operation IceBridge data, finding damage in areas with known crevasses and rifts.  Backstress is highest near the grounding line and upstream of ice rises, in agreement with patterns observed on other ice shelves.  The ice in contact with the Bawden ice rise is weakened by fractures, and additional damage or thinning in this area could diminish the backstress transmitted upstream.  We model the consequences for the ice shelf if it loses contact with this small ice rise, finding that flow speeds would increase by 25\% or more over an area the size of the former Larsen B ice shelf.  Such a perturbation could potentially destabilize the northern part of Larsen C along pre-existing lines of weakness, highlighting the importance of the feedback between buttressing and fracturing in an ice shelf.},

Buttressing effects are analysed for a situation where a stable grounding line is located on a bed sloping upwards in the direction of flow. Such grounding-line positions are known to be unconditionally unstable in the absence of transverse flow variations. It is shown that ice-shelf buttressing can restore stability under these conditions. Ice flux at the grounding line is, in general, not a monotonically increasing function of ice thickness. This, possibly at first somewhat counterintuitive result, is found to be fully consistent with recent theoretical work. Grounding lines on retrograde slopes are conditionally stable, and the stability regime is a non-trivial function of bed and ice-shelf geometry. The stability of grounding lines cannot be assessed from considerations of local bed slope only.},

  abstract = {Iceberg calving has been assumed to be the dominant cause of mass loss for the Antarctic ice sheet, with previous estimates of the calving flux exceeding 2,000 gigatonnes per year. More recently, the importance of melting by the ocean has been demonstrated close to the grounding line and near the calving front. So far, however, no study has reliably quantified the calving flux and the basal mass balance (the balance between accretion and ablation at the ice-shelf base) for the whole of Antarctica. The distribution of fresh water in the Southern Ocean and its partitioning between the liquid and solid phases is therefore poorly constrained. Here we estimate the mass balance components for all ice shelves in Antarctica, using satellite measurements of calving flux and grounding-line flux, modelled ice-shelf snow accumulation rates and a regional scaling that accounts for unsurveyed areas. We obtain a total calving flux of 1,321 \ensuremath{\pm} 144 gigatonnes per year and a total basal mass balance of -1,454 \ensuremath{\pm} 174 gigatonnes per year. This means that about half of the ice-sheet surface mass gain is lost through oceanic erosion before reaching the ice front, and the calving flux is about 34 per cent less than previous estimates derived from iceberg tracking. In addition, the fraction of mass loss due to basal processes varies from about 10 to 90 per cent between ice shelves. We find a significant positive correlation between basal mass loss and surface elevation change for ice shelves experiencing surface lowering and enhanced discharge. We suggest that basal mass loss is a valuable metric for predicting future ice-shelf vulnerability to oceanic forcing.},

It is shown that SSA provides a crude but robust approximation of strange attractors by tori, in the presence of noise. The method works well for short, noisy time series.

The lagged-covariance matrix of the processes studied is the basis of SSA. We select subsets of eigenelements and associated principal components (PCs) in order to provide (i) a noise-reduction algorithm, (ii) a detrending algorithm, and (iii) an algorithm for the identification of oscillatory components. Reconstructed components (RCs) are developed to provide optimal reconstruction of a dynamic process at precise epochs, rather than averaged over the window length of the analysis.

SSA is combined with advanced spectral-analysis methods - the maximum entropy method (MEM) and the multi-taper method (MTM) - to refine the interpretation of oscillatory behavior. A combined SSA-MEM method is also used for the prediction of selected subsets of RCs.

The entire toolkit is validated against a set of four prescribed time series generated by known processes, quasi-periodic or chaotic. It is also applied to a time series of global surface air temperatures, 130 years long, which has attracted considerable attention in the context of the global warming issue and provides a severe test for noise reduction and prediction.},

Over the period April 2002 to November 2009, averaged ice loss rates in eastern Greenland (120 +/- 31 Gt/yr) are still significantly larger than those in the west (86.3 +/- 22 Gt/yr). However, the estimated ice loss rate from glaciers in northwest Greenland has increased from 30.9 +/- 8 Gt/yr over the first few years (2002{\textendash}2005) to 128.2 +/- 33 Gt/yr for the more recent period (2007{\textendash}2009), while the loss rate in southeast Greenland for the more recent period has become almost negligible, down from 109 +/- 28 Gt/yr of just a few years ago. The rapid change in the nature of the regional ice mass in southeast and northwest Greenland, in the course of only several years, further reinforces the idea that the Greenland ice sheet mass balance is very vulnerable to regional climate conditions. The dramatic slow down of ice loss in southeast Greenland observed by GRACE provides an independent verification of similar reports from other remote sensing data. The observed significant interannual variability of Greenland ice mass change suggests that it is very challenging to quantify Greenland's long-term ice mass change rates, and some observed apparent accelerations might simply be a reflection of the interannual variability.},

The observations reveal that the Wilkins break-ups occur through a distinctive type of shelf calving, which we term 'disintegration', as well as more typical rifting and calving. Here we focus on the disintegration process, which is characterized by repeated rapid fracturing that creates narrow ice-edge-parallel blocks, with subsequent block toppling and fragmentation forming an expanding iceberg and ice rubble mass. We use these data to develop and test a model of floating ice plate disintegration in which ice plate bending stresses at the ice front arising from buoyancy forces can lead to runaway calving when free (mobile) water is available. High-resolution satellite images and laser altimetry of the first break-up event provide details of fracture spacings, ice thicknesses, and plate bending profiles that agree well with our model predictions. We suggest that surface or near-surface meltwater is the main pre-condition for disintegration, and that hydro-fracture is the main mechanism. Brine layers from near-waterline brine infiltration can support a similar process, but this is less effective unless regional ice stress patterns contribute to the net stress available at the crack tip for fracturing. A combination of brine-enhanced fracturing and changing internal net extensional stresses was the likely mechanism behind the latter two Wilkins events. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The NASA and ESA retracking algorithms are compared with an algorithm based upon a combined surface and volume (S/V) scattering model. First, the S/V, NASA, and ESA algorithms were used to retrack over 1.3 million altimeter return waveforms from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The surface elevations from the S/V algorithm were compared with the elevations produced by the NASA and ESA algorithms to determine the relative accuracy of these algorithms when subsurface volume scattering occurs. The results show that the ESA25\% algorithm produced slightly higher surface elevations than the S/V algorithm. The NASA retracking algorithm produced lower surface elevations than the SN retracking algorithm, with average differences ranging from -0.3 to -0.9 m. The lower NASA elevations can only account for a portion of previously reported differences between altimeter and geoceiver surface elevations, suggesting that the remainder is probably due to orbital differences. Next, by analyzing several thousand satellite crossover points from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, the author estimated the repeatability of the surface elevations derived from the different retracking algorithms. The elevations derived from the ESA25\% and S/V algorithm had the smallest standard deviations for the crossover differences for a time period where no significant change in surface elevation should occur. The NASA standard deviations were approximately 0.2 m larger than those from the ESA25\% and S/V algorithm, which represents an average increase in error of approximately 0.5 m in the datasets. Since previous ice-sheet growth estimates have been based upon the elevations produced by the NASA retracking algorithm, further work needs to be conducted to determine if the ESA25\% or S/V retracking algorithms produce growth estimates that are significantly different from the previous estimates},

The equilibrium response of the model was compared with ice-core density profiles from Byrd, Antarctica and Site 2, Greenland, and the model predicted the density to within 10\% of both cores.. The response of the model to step-wise changes and random fluctuations in the surface boundary conditions was investigated. The standard deviation of elevation changes as a function of observation interval was computed. These changes were found to be small in comparison with the magnitude of present uncertainties in the mass balances of the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets. It was concluded that, in the dry snow zones, natural variability in the densification will not prevent the geodetic determination of ice sheet mass balance from improving upon current estimates. Uncertainty in the constitutive equation for snow and firn is the dominant source of error in the calculations.},

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of marine ice sheets is integral to studying the evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet in both the short and long terms. An important component of the dynamics, grounding line migration, has proved difficult to represent in numerical models, and most successful attempts have made use of techniques that are only readily applicable to flow line models. However, to capture the stress transmission involved in another important component, the buttressing of a marine ice sheet by its ice shelf, the transverse direction must also be resolved. We introduce a model that solves the time-dependent shelfy stream equations and makes use of mesh adaption techniques to overcome the difficulties typically associated with the numerics of grounding line migration. We compare the model output with a recent benchmark for flow line models and show that our model yields an accurate solution while using far less resources than would be required without mesh adaption. We also show that the mesh adapting techniques extend to two horizontal dimensions. Experiments are carried out to determine how both ice shelf buttressing and ice rises affect the marine instability predicted for an ice sheet on a foredeepened bed. We find that buttressing is not always sufficient to stabilize such a sheet but collapse of the grounded portion is still greatly delayed. We also find that the effect of an ice rise is similar to that of narrowing the ice shelf.},

  abstract = {The Jakobshavn Effect is a series of positive feedback mechanisms that was first observed on Jakobshavn Isbrae, which drains the west-central part of the Greenland Ice Sheet and enters Jakobshavn Isfjord at 69{\textdegree}10'. These mechanisms fall into two categories, reductions of ice-bed coupling beneath an ice stream due to surface meltwater reaching the bed, and reductions in ice-shelf buttressing beyond an ice stream due to disintegration of a laterally confined and locally pinned ice shelf. These uncoupling and unbuttressing mechanisms have recently taken place for Byrd Glacier in Antarctica and Jakobshavn Isbrae in Greenland, respectively.  For Byrd Glacier, no surface meltwater reaches the bed. That water is supplied by drainage of two large subglacial lakes where East Antarctic ice converges strongly on Byrd Glacier. Results from modeling both mechanisms are presented here. We find that the Jakobshavn Effect is not active for Byrd Glacier, but is active for Jakobshavn Isbrae, at least for now.  Our treatment is holistic in the sense it provides continuity from sheet flow to stream flow to shelf flow. It relies primarily on a force balance, so our results cannot be used to predict long-term behavior of these ice streams. The treatment uses geometrical representations of gravitational and resisting forces that provide a visual understanding of these forces, without involving partial differential equations and continuum mechanics. The Jakobshavn Effect was proposed to facilitate terminations of glaciation cycles during the Quaternary Ice Age by collapsing marine parts of ice sheets. This is unlikely for the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, based on our results for Byrd Glacier and Jakobshavn Isbrae, without drastic climate warming in high polar latitudes. Warming would affect other Antarctic ice streams already weakly buttressed or unbuttressed by an ice shelf. Ross Ice Shelf would still protect Byrd Glacier.},

This long and regular time series is processed using an along-track algorithm to depict in detail the spatial and temporal pattern of elevation change for the whole ice sheet. We use this dataset to examine the spatial and temporal pattern of Pine Island Glacier (PIG) thinning and compare it to the neighbouring glaciers. We also examine additional areas, especially in East Antarctica whose mass balance is poorly known. One advantage of the finer along-track spacing of measurements is that it reveals places of dynamic thinning in regions of rapid ice flow. We observe the acceleration of thinning on PIG. Over the entire basin, the volume loss increased from 7 km3 a{\textendash}1 during 2002{\textendash}06 to \ensuremath{\sim}48 km3 a{\textendash}1 during 2006{\textendash}10. We also observe accelerated thinning on the lower tens of kilometres of Thwaites Glacier, with a mean thinning of 0.18 m a{\textendash}1 over its entire basin during our observation period.

  abstract = {Abstract Singular systems (or singular spectrum) analysis (SSA) was originally proposed for noise reduction in the analysis of experimental data and is now becoming widely used to identify intermittent or modulated oscillations in geophysical and climatic time series. Progress has been hindered by a lack of effective statistical tests to discriminate between potential oscillations and anything but the simplest form of noise, that is, {\textquotedblleft}white{\textquotedblright} (independent, identically distributed) noise, in which power is independent of frequency. The authors show how the basic formalism of SSA provides a natural test for modulated oscillations against an arbitrary {\textquotedblleft}colored noise{\textquotedblright} null hypothesis. This test, Monte Carlo SSA, is illustrated using synthetic data in three situations: (i) where there is prior knowledge of the power-spectral characteristics of the noise, a situation expected in some laboratory and engineering applications, or when the {\textquotedblleft}noise{\textquotedblright} against which the data is being tested consists of the output of an independently specified model, such as a climate model; (ii) where a simple hypothetical noise model is tested, namely, that the data consists only of white or colored noise; and (iii) where a composite hypothetical noise model is tested, assuming some deterministic components have already been found in the data, such as a trend or annual cycle, and it needs to be established whether the remainder may be attributed to noise. The authors examine two historical temperature records and show that the strength of the evidence provided by SSA for interannual and interdecadal climate oscillations in such data has been considerably overestimated. In contrast, multiple inter- and subannual oscillatory components are identified in an extended Southern Oscillation index at a high significance level. The authors explore a number of variations on the Monte Carlo SSA algorithm and note that it is readily applicable to multivariate series, covering standard empirical orthogonal functions and multichannel SSA.},

  abstract = {A structural glaciological description and analysis of surface morphological features of the Larsen C ice shelf, Antarctic Peninsula, is derived from satellite images spanning the period 1963-2007. The data are evaluated in two time ranges: a comparison of a 1963 satellite image photomosaic with a modern digital mosaic compiled using 2003/04 austral summer data; and an image series since 2003 showing recent evolution of the shelf. We map the ice-shelf edge, rift swarms, crevasses and crevasse traces, and linear longitudinal structures (called 'flow stripes' or 'streak lines'). The latter are observed to be continuous over distances of up to 200km from the grounding line to the ice-shelf edge, with little evidence of changes in pattern over that distance. Integrated velocity measurements along a flowline indicate that the shelf has been stable for similar to 560years in the mid-shelf area. Linear longitudinal features may be grouped into 12 units, each related to one or a small group of outlet feeder glaciers to the shelf. We observe that the boundaries between these flow units often mark rift terminations. The boundary zones originate upstream at capes, islands or other suture areas between outlet glaciers. In agreement with previous work, our findings imply that rift terminations within such suture zones indicate that they contain anomalously soft ice. We thus suggest that suture zones within the Larsen C ice shelf, and perhaps within ice shelves more generally, may act to stabilize them by reducing regional stress intensities and thus rates of rift lengthening.},

  abstract = {Ranges obtained by radar altimetry from a satellite to a sloping surface on the earth are not measurements of the surface elevation at the subsatellite point. Instead, the reflecting point is displaced upslope from the subsatellite point causing a 'slope-induced error' between the true range to the subsatellite point and the indicated range. For the SEASAT 1 altimeter, this range error is nearly 80 m for a 0.8 degree slope. Ice sheet surface slopes are frequently large enough to cause errors of 10 m or more. In addition, undulations in the surface about a mean slope cause pronounced variations in these errors. Altimeter measurements of ranges to modeled irregular surfaces are simulated and two correction schemes are used to reconstruct the modeled surfaces from the simulated data. The results illustrate the fundamental limitations inherent in single-beam radar altimetry for mapping irregular surfaces. In the simpler two-dimensional case, for which cross-track slopes are neglected, a relocation scheme, which constructs a surface consistent with the altimeter ranges, removes 85\% of the rms error. The mean error along profiles of about 75 km or longer is usually reduced more than the rms error. An alternate slope correction scheme, which uses the local slope to calculate the expected error, is less effective in the two-dimensional case. However, over a simulated three-dimensional surface, where groundtracks are widely spaced and cross-track slopes are significant, the slope-correction method must be used in at least the cross-track direction. The effectiveness of the three-dimensional correction depends on the relative size of the errors caused by the local slope on surface undulations in comparison to the regional slope.},

The guide includes a comparison to the windowed Fourier transform, the choice of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects due to finite-length time series, and the relationship between wavelet scale and Fourier frequency. New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. It is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. Empirical formulas are given for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals. Extensions to wavelet analysis such as filtering, the power Hovm{\"o}ller, cross-wavelet spectra, and coherence are described. The statistical significance tests are used to give a quantitative measure of changes in ENSO variance on interdecadal timescales. Using new datasets that extend back to 1871, the Ni{\~n}o3 sea surface temperature and the Southern Oscillation index show significantly higher power during 1880{\textendash}1920 and 1960{\textendash}90, and lower power during 1920{\textendash}60, as well as a possible 15-yr modulation of variance.

  abstract = {We present a technique for investigating the grounding zone (GZ) of Antarctic ice shelves using laser altimetry from the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat). Most surface height variability in the GZ is easily resolved by the ICESat laser's \ensuremath{\sim}65 m footprint and \ensuremath{\sim}172 m along-track spacing. Comparisons of repeated tracks sampled at different phases of the ocean tide identify the landward and seaward limits of tide-forced ice flexure, providing GZ location and width information for each track. Using ICESat data in the Institute Ice Stream region of southern Ronne Ice Shelf, we demonstrate that the location of the GZ based on feature identification in satellite imagery or digital elevation models may be in error by several km. Our results show that ICESat will contribute significantly to improving knowledge of GZ structure and to studies requiring accurate GZ locations, e.g., ice mass balance calculations and ice-sheet/ocean modeling.},

We derived these products using data from a variety of sources, including many substantial surveys completed since the original Bedmap compilation (Bedmap1) in 2001. In particular, the Bedmap2 ice thickness grid is made from 25 million measurements, over two orders of magnitude more than were used in Bedmap1. In most parts of Antarctica the subglacial landscape is visible in much greater detail than was previously available and the improved data-coverage has in many areas revealed the full scale of mountain ranges, valleys, basins and troughs, only fragments of which were previously indicated in local surveys. The derived statistics for Bedmap2 show that the volume of ice contained in the Antarctic ice sheet (27 million km3) and its potential contribution to sea-level rise (58 m) are similar to those of Bedmap1, but the mean thickness of the ice sheet is 4.6\% greater, the mean depth of the bed beneath the grounded ice sheet is 72 m lower and the area of ice sheet grounded on bed below sea level is increased by 10\%. The Bedmap2 compilation highlights several areas beneath the ice sheet where the bed elevation is substantially lower than the deepest bed indicated by Bedmap1. These products, along with grids of data coverage and uncertainty, provide new opportunities for detailed modelling of the past and future evolution of the Antarctic ice sheets.},

  abstract = {We use laser altimetry from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) to map the grounding zone (GZ) of the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica, at 491 locations where ICESat tracks cross the grounding line (GL). Ice flexure in the GZ occurs as the ice shelf responds to short-term sea-level changes due primarily to tides. ICESat repeat-track analysis can be used to detect this region of flexure since each repeated pass is acquired at a different tidal phase; the technique provides estimates for both the landward limit of flexure and the point where the ice becomes hydrostatically balanced. We find that the ICESat-derived landward limits of tidal flexure are, in many places, offset by several km (and up to \ensuremath{\sim}60 km) from the GL mapped previously using other satellite methods. We discuss the reasons why different mapping methods lead to different GL estimates, including: instrument limitations; variability in the surface topographic structure of the GZ; and the presence of ice plains. We conclude that reliable and accurate mapping of the GL is most likely to be achieved when based on synthesis of several satellite datasets.},

This adaptive filter consists of projecting the data onto the leading temporal empirical orthogonal functions obtained from singular spectrum analysis (SSA). The combined SSA-MEM method is applied both to a synthetic time series and a time series of atmospheric angular momentum (AAM) data. The procedure is very effective when the background noise is white and less so when the background noise is red. The latter case obtains in the AAM data. Nevertheless, we detect reliable evidence for intraseasonal and interannual oscillations in AAM. The interannual periods include a quasi-biennial one and a low-frequency one, of 5 years, both related to the El Ni{\~n}o/Southern Oscillation. In the intraseasonal band, separate oscillations of about 48.5 and 51 days are ascertained.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses the models of the tropical atmosphere. Models are powerful tools with a variety of uses: predictions, studies of the sensitivity of the atmosphere to external factors, and the generation of comprehensive data sets for the detailed analyses of specific phenomena. The most sophisticated models of the atmosphere, the General Circulation Models, simulate the Southern Oscillation realistically and demonstrate that it is caused by temperature variations in the tropical Pacific Ocean. These models provide a wealth of information about the atmospheric response to different sea surface temperature patterns and about the dynamical and thermodynamical balances during different phases of the Southern Oscillation. The General Circulation Models are complex and simpler models are necessary to isolate and study the role of specific physical processes in various phenomena. The simple models fall into two groups. One group describes the response of the atmosphere to given heat sources. The second group of simple models addresses the question of how the position and intensity of the heat sources relate to a given sea surface temperature pattern.},

In this paper we present a new method based on a "local" eigenexpansion to estimate the spectrum in terms of the solution of an integral equation. Computationally this method is equivalent to using the weishted average of a series of direct-spectrum estimates based on orthogonal data windows (discrete prolate spheroidal sequences) to treat both the bias and smoothing problems. Some of the attractive features of this estimate are: there are no arbitrary windows; it is a small sample theory; it is consistent; it provides an analysis-of-variance test for line components; and it has high resolution. We also show relations of this estimate to maximum-likelihood estimates, show that the estimation capacity of the estimate is high, and show applications to coherence and polyspectrum estimates.},

  abstract = {The term singular spectrum comes from the spectral (eigenvalue) decomposition of a matrix A into its set (spectrum) of eigenvalues. These eigenvalues, A, are the numbers that make the matrix A -AI singular. The term singular spectrum analysis\ensuremath{\cdot} is unfortunate since the traditional eigenvalue decomposition involving multivariate data is also an analysis of the singular spectrum. More properly, singular spectrum analysis (SSA) should be called the analysis of time series using the singular spectrum. Spectral decomposition of matrices is fundamental to much the ory of linear algebra and it has many applications to problems in the natural and related sciences. Its widespread use as a tool for time series analysis is fairly recent, however, emerging to a large extent from applications of dynamical systems theory (sometimes called chaos theory). SSA was introduced into chaos theory by Fraedrich (1986) and Broomhead and King (l986a). Prior to this, SSA was used in biological oceanography by Colebrook (1978). In the digi tal signal processing community, the approach is also known as the Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) expansion (Pike et aI., 1984). Like other techniques based on spectral decomposition, SSA is attractive in that it holds a promise for a reduction in the dimen- {\textbullet} Singular spectrum analysis is sometimes called singular systems analysis or singular spectrum approach. vii viii Preface sionality.

  abstract = {This paper describes the CryoSat satellite mission, due for launch in 2005, whose aim is to accurately determine the trends in Earth's continental and marine ice fields. The paper's purpose is to provide scientific users of the CryoSat data with a description of the design and operation of the SIRAL radar and the CryoSat platform, the data products, and the expected error budget. The 'low-resolution mode' (LRM), 'synthetic aperture mode' (SARM) and "synthetic aperture interferometric mode' (SARInM) of the SIRAL radar are described, together with its system parameters, its antenna gain pattern and interferometer phase difference pattern, and its calibration modes. The orbit is described, together with the platform attitude and altitude control law and control systems, and the expected pointing and altitude knowledge. The geographical masks that are used to determine acquisitions in the three SIRAL modes are described. The SIRAL data products, and the processing applied to produce them, are described. Level 1b, level 2 and higher-level products are described in turn, with a particular emphasis on the new procedures applied to the SARInM and SARM processing over ice surfaces. The beam forming and multi-looking is summarised, and a description is given of the behaviour of the SARM and SARInM echoes over idealised surfaces. These inform descriptions of the elevation retrievals of the level 2 processing, including the SARInM retrieval of interferometric phase. The combination of these data, through cross-over analysis over continental ice sheets, and through averaging over sea-ice, to determine areal averages of ice sheet elevation change or sea-ice thickness, is described. The error budget in these higher-level products is described, together with its breakdown into errors arising from the instrument and errors arising from the retrievals. The importance of the co-variance of these errors in determining the final error is stressed. The description of the errors also includes a summary of the experiments required following the launch to validate the CryoSat mission data. An estimate of the mission performance over ice surfaces is made at various spatial scales, and it is concluded that even the relatively short, three-year duration of the CryoSat mission will allow it to make an important scientific contribution, particularly when combined with results from earlier satellite missions. ?? 2005 COSPAR.},

The rough "surface" impulse response and the echo and interferometric cross product are determined as functions of the beam direction and the vector surface gradient. These expressions are used to determine the multilooked echo and interferometric phase from such a system. The "effective" number of looks and the multilooked echo coherence, which determine the statistics of the echo power and the interferometric phase, are defined. The dependence of the multilooked echo power and interferometric phase are investigated as functions of the surface vector gradient, surface roughness, volume scattering, and SNR. These behaviors are illustrated using values based on a practical system. The precision of the elevation measurement is examined in the light of the effective number of looks and the coherence of the multilooked echo and cross product. Some conclusions concerning the practical recovery of the range from the echo power are discussed.},
